Preface
In 1810, a great empowerment ceremony was held in Mongolia.
The Panchen Lama, His Holiness Tenpei Nyima, was visiting
from Tibet. Day after day, hundreds or possibly thousands of
people, from high lamas, Chinese imperial officials and monastic
officials down to ordinary monks and lay people, gathered to
receive from him the four empowerments of the great mandala of
the Primordial Buddha.' To mark the occasion, a set of pictorial
blockprints was commissioned, depicting the deities of three great
cycles of empowerments that the Panchen Lama would certainly
have been accustomed to give. They comprised 507 small images,
printed three to a page in the usual loose-leaf format of Tibetan
books. On the back of each image, mantras were printed, to help
imbue it with the presence of the deity represented in the center,
reading downwards, the five syllables OM ÄH HUM PHAT SVĀHA,
invoking the Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities and Activities of a
Buddha, and around them the deity's own mantra and a general
mantra.
published an account of a set of the blockprints he had acquired
from a lama there. In 1963–4 and on other occasions, Lokesh
Chandra has reproduced a complete set he originally claimed was
purchased by his father, Raghu Vira, from a monk in Ulan Bator
in 1956, though it now appears the drawings he published may
have derived ultimately from a blockprint set in Leningrad. In
this way the blockprints have become quite widely known in the
West.
Unfortunately, the name under which they are best known
is entirely misleading, Pander somehow got the mistaken idea
that they were produced at Narthang Monastery in Tibet, and by
the time Clark's index appeared they were being called the 'Five
Hundred Gods of Narthang. This is a double error. Not only do
they originate from Mongolia rather than Narthang, but though
there are about five hundred images, many of the images depict
more than one deity and many of the deities are not gods but
goddesses. 'Five Hundred Images', a name used in Tibetan (sku-
brñan Ina-brgya), is valid; 'Five Hundred Gods' is not. It is time to
reinstate the authentic Tibetan title of the blockprint set, Bris-sku
mthon-ba don-ldan, 'Icons Worthwhile to See'.
The images of Icons Worthwhile to See are published in the
present volume, but not in their familiar blockprinted form.
Instead, we present them as a unique and exquisitely beautiful set
of miniature paintings, now in the collection of the Völkerkunde-
museum der Universität Zürich. Far sharper and more detailed
than the blockprints, the paintings also have the advantage of
being in full color.
Icons Worthwhile to See is of exceptional importance to the study
The blockprints became known to Western scholars in 1890,
when Eugen Pander came across a set in Peking and published
some of the images, substituting them for corresponding pictures
from the quite different pantheon of three hundred images his
paper was actually presenting, because of their superior artistic
quality. This or another copy eventually reached Berlin where,
though unpublished, it was used by scholars such as Albert Grün-
wedel and (through photographs) Walter Eugene Clark. The
latter included it as Pantheon C in his index of four collections
of Tibetan Buddhist deity images, published in 1937. In 1943

Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
of Tibetan Buddhist iconography because the texts it illustrates are
known and available. These texts are compilations of sādhanas,
rites for the daily practice of each deity. They describe how to
visualize the deity and what to do when the visualization has
been generated. The intended function of the pictures is as aids to
assist the generation of the deity visualization, especially during
the rite of conferring on disciples permission to practice the deity.
In the present work, we restore the pictures to their context by
publishing not the pictures alone but translations from the texts
as well. In this way we seek to serve scholars and practitioners
alike.
The book falls into three principal sections, devoted respec-
tively to the paintings, the source texts, and reference materi-
als that cover both. A single system of numbering is employed
throughout, so that one can refer immediately between the three
sections.
The first section introduces the paintings and reproduces them
along with transcriptions and translations of their captions. The
second section presents the translations from the sadhanas, divided
like the paintings into three parts corresponding the three
sādhana compilations. These are first the Rinjung Gyatsa (Icons
4 420), then the shorter and simpler Narthang Gyatsa (421-456),
then the Vajrávali trilogy of Abhayākaragupta (457-507). The last
is a collection of mandalas, but Icons Worthwhile to See illustrates
only the principal deities. In addition, the painted version of
Icons Worthwhile to See boasts an appendix of three pictures of
Yamāntaka, not found in the blockprint versions,
The extensive set of reference materials that follows the transla-
tions includes English, Tibetan, Sanskrit and Mongolian indexes
and a morphological index, which will be found of great value in
identifying deity images. The English index is particularly com-
prehensive, including not only names but entries for iconographic
features, explanations of technical terms, and analytical articles.
This is complemented by a pictorial index, featuring drawings and
text by Robert Beer, to provide a visual key to the iconographic
features and an artist's insight into their symbolism.
It is impossible for a work of this size and complexity to be
free of errors and inconsistencies. Every attempt has been made
to eliminate them by way of numerous cross-checks, and even
reverse checking of many of the index entries; for those that
remain, whether due to oversight or ignorance, we can only
apologize.

I. The Paintings



Introduction
Martin Brauen
Whether it is a reproduction or an original version is not safe to
say without further research.'
The finding, loss and rediscovery of the Icons Worth-
while to See
In autumn 1973 Dr Eva Stoll, curator at the Völkerkundemuseum
der Universität Zürich, received for inspection a volume that put
under its spell everyone who got to see it. The book contained
red-bordered pages, bound one to the other concertina-fashion.
On each of the relatively thick leaves there appeared on both recto
and verso sides three miniature paintings of Tibetan Buddhist
deities and saints. Dr Stoll recognized straight away that this was
a special rarity, for which reason she let the vendor, a gallery in
Bonn, later deliver the remaining volumes of the four-volume set.
The offer of sale included a brief description by Prof. Wolfgang
Schulemann, of Bonn. In his expert's report, Schulemann men-
tioned publications that contained depictions similar to those in
the four volumes offered to the Völkerkundemuseum, but with
the difference that all the other collections known were only line
drawings, which meant they were not colored. Schulemann
emphasized, The four-volume work is about the "500 Gods of
Narthang", but the present volumes are under no circumstances
a painted version (Ausmalung) of the publication of Raghu Vira
& Lokesh Chandra.' Schulemann justified this with the comment
that 'The prints in Vira & Chandra are much more complicated and
confused than the clear pictures in the work under examination),
painted simply and correctly in their symbolism and ornamenta-
tion.' Summing up, Schulemann wrote: 'We have here [in the four
volumes) a painted version of a Tibetan lamaist pantheon gener-
ally called in the literature the Five Hundred Gods of Narthang.
In November 1973 the Völkerkundemuseum der Universität
Zürich had its own expert report made, in fact by Mr Friedrich A.
Peter, who had lived for a long time in Ladakh and in 1943 had
published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal the
article 'The "Rin-'byun": Introduction to an unpublished Tibetan
Iconographical Work. For Peter it was certain that 'the set of
four albums of miniatures loaned to us for inspection and review
represents a most interesting lamaistic iconographical work. The
designs for the miniatures are beyond any doubt copies of the
original edition of blockprints of the Rin-'byun, sNar-than-brgya-
rtsa and rDor-'phren, which as is clear from the colophon came
into existence in Mongolia probably in the eighteenth century,
illustrating the Rin-than by the Panchen Lama bLo-bzan bs Tan-pa'i
Ni-ma. This collection has been known to modern research under
the somewhat unfortunate designation "The Five Hundred Gods
of Narthang". Peter compared the four painted volumes with an
almost identical collection of woodblock prints, which had been
presented to him during his many years' residence in Ladakh. His
conclusion: 'It is certain that[the pictures in the set of four albums]
were copied by a photo-mechanical process from an original print
In many places the original designs and especially the lettering
are clearly discernible under the paint. The pages have been
consecutively numbered, which in the original [they were not...

these miniatures whose artistry is amazing and craftsmanship

or at least nearly square format, which are useful in initiations
and when visualizing. They are an aid making it easier for a
meditating person to visualize the individual Buddhas, deities
and holy beings.
The individual parts are not divided clearly in the manuscript,
so that to the uninitiated the four volumes appear as a single work.
The legends in the left-hand margins of the pages, however, reveal
that in fact three separate works are included. Icons numbers 1
to 420 constitute the principal part, the so-called Rinjung Gyatsa
(Rin-'byun brgya-rtsa). Numbers 421 to 456 are the Narthang Gyatsa
(sNar-than brgya-rtsa), while numbers 457 to 507 portray the Dor-
tr'eng (rDor-'phren, Skt Vajravali). The last three icons (508 to 510)
are an appendix.
superb.
We shall in due course return to a closer analysis of some of the
points mentioned by Peter, including for example his assertion
that the miniatures in their painted version were 'copied by a
photo-mechanical process from an original print', an assertion
that-let us anticipate this already—will be proved incorrect.
In spite of the expert reports by Schulemann and Peter, Dr
Stoll did not succeed in raising the necessary financial means to
purchase the four volumes, and therefore in spring 1974 with a
heavy heart she had to return them. She was sure this meant that
this collection, uniquely important to the study of both art and
religion, would be lost to the Völkerkundemuseum for ever. Not
only this, but because there was apparently no other prospective
purchaser, she even feared the collection might some day be
broken up and the pages sold separately, whereby this precious,
unparalleled work would be forever destroyed.
Luckily, however, fate took another turn: in 1978 I called on
an acquaintance who over the course of many years had acquired
in his extensive travels some objects that he now wished to offer
for sale to the Museum. Was it intuition or was it coincidence?
I began to enthuse about the beautiful collection of five hundred
icons, which had not gone out of my mind since I had seen it
six years before in my predecessor's office. To my surprise, it
turned out my acquaintance was the owner of the collection!
He had been hoping for years that the gallery in Bonn would
sell the four volumes for him. In the end he had given up
hope- he looked after the volumes in a bank safe ..., until
that memorable day when I became a minor Tertön (gter-ston,
treasure-revealer), and I resolved not to let this second chance
escape. I commissioned reports from further experts (Hans Roth
of the Seminar für Sprach- und Kulturwissenschaft Zentralasiens
der Universität Bonn; and Ulrich von Schroeder, Zürich). They
said it was indeed a remarkable collection that should belong
to a museum and be published. Thanks to a donation by the
Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft (Union Bank of Switzerland), the
work was eventually acquired for the Völkerkundemuseum der
Universität Zürich in the year 1980.1
Origins
We have become acquainted with the eventful recent history of the
work, but where did it come from originally? On this we can only
speculate, as the vendor has simply informed us that he acquired
the four volumes in 1972 in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Several signs indicate that the work - although it is to be
assigned to Tibetan Buddhism-must have been produced and
kept in either China or Mongolia. The first such indication is
the Chinese fabric with which the two wooden covers of each
of the four volumes are covered. This is a fabric that shows a
floral, geometric pattern (Fig. 1) and can be assigned to the Ch'ing
dynasty.
In addition, a small red label on each of the four volumes, in-
scribed in Chinese First (Vol.)', 'Second (Vol.y and so on, indicates
a Chinese provenance. Also Chinese is the numbering of the indi-
vidual folios in the lower left margin. As meticulous examination
verifies, there exist likewise what appear to be Chinese numerals
in the top margin in the center of each individual picture, which
are however no longer visible as they have been overpainted.
There are also Chinese inscriptions (identifying the volume) on
three of the book covers, beneath the inner, red covering material
(Fig. 2).
Further, the way in which the painted pages have been mounted
in cardboard and claret fabric, as well as the concertina-style
assembly, points to Chinese or Mongolian manufacture, but not
Tibetan.
A Mongolian origin is not to be ruled out, because two sources

a square (Fig. 3), which approximately coincided with the square
framing the figure portrayed on the front. In other words: the
work contains all the mantras belonging to the individual figures.
They are, however, not visible, as during the assembly of the
individual book pages they were covered up by sticking on several
layers of paper. The 'discovery of the mantras belonging to each
of the miniature paintings came as quite a sensation, as hitherto
no one had suspected or detected the existence of these characters
in the four volumes.
mention that similar works, found today in Germany and India
respectively, came originally from Mongolia: namely the Peter
blockprint set (Peter 1943: 1) and the Lokesh Chandra set (Lokesh
Chandra 1986: 52). We know moreover that in the year 1810
the treasurer of the Manchu emperor Chia-ch'ing and a number
of other Buddhist dignitaries 'requested that blockprints be pre-
pared/Of the Rinjung and the Narthang Gyatsas/ And the mandalas
of the Vajrávali, in order that 'upholders of the Doctrine might/
Live long, and all beings gain Enlightenment." As we shall see
later, the present work also goes back to these same woodblocks
produced some time after 1810.
The Völkerkundemuseum's set-unlike those of Peter, Tachi-
kawa et al. and Lokesh Chandra-displays in the right-hand mar-
gin of each picture the name of the relevant figure in Mongolian
script.7 Investigations into the original inscriptions, which will
be described below, indicate that the Mongolian inscriptions-
in contrast to the Tibetan inscriptions-were only applied to the
completed miniature paintings at the end and were not part of the
overpainted line drawings.
Despite the osed Chinese perhaps, Mongolian origin of
the work, it is certain that the pictures were painted fully within
the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism; accordingly they show none, or
only the most marginal, of the characteristics of Chinese painting
style.
An unexpected discovery
But how were the miniature paintings produced, how were the
drawings of the figures transferred to the paper? It was very soon
shown that to answer this question a more precise investigation
in a specialized laboratory would be needed. Annette Meier
and Alexander Voûte of the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum in
Zürich kindly declared themselves ready to carry out such an
investigation.
As the red fabric border on the folio with paintings 241-243
had become easily detachable, this folio was selected for more
intensive analysis. By chance this folio is identical to one of those
printed by Grünwedel (1970: 9). The relatively thick layer of paper
on the reverse side of the folio, above all that behind or underneath
painting 241, was carefully removed, and what thus came to light
surpassed all expectations: little by little appeared characters,
which eventually proved to be mantras, or dhāranis, arranged in
The woodblock editions
Up to now, besides the one reproduced here, several complete
or nearly complete sets of the Icons Worthwhile to See have been
known-all with only outline drawings of the deities.
One copy was kept, according to Peter, in Berlin. Grünwedel
used several drawings from it in his book Mythologie des Buddhis-
mus (see Figs 4 and 82 in Grünwedel 1970). It is nowadays in the
Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich.
Clark, in his introduction to Two Lamaistic Pantheons, refers
to another copy, which belonged to Berthold Laufer and should
accordingly have come into the possession of the Field Museum
in Chicago. According to oral information from John Huntington,
this copy is no longer to be found.
In Ladakh in the thirties, Peter acquired another copy of the
work, which he subsequently brought to Switzerland. Together
with his sister Elisabeth, he copied the drawings and mantras by
hand, and in 1943, as we have mentioned, published a small part
in an article in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. The
original copy is kept at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich;
the location of the hand drawings is not known.
According to Lokesh Chandra, his father, Prof. Raghu Vira,
managed to acquire 'a xylographic edition' of the Icons Worthwhile
to See in 1956 from a lama in Ulan Bator. Lokesh Chandra
published a set of the Icons as Parts 8 and 9 of A New Tibeto-
Mongol Pantheon, and reprinted it in a handy form in Buddhist
Iconography. Both these publications constitute what we shall call
'the Chandra edition'. Although the accompanying text conveys
the impression that what the Chandra edition reproduced was
his father's blockprinted copy, we shall show below that this
claim, and with it the authenticity of the Icons published by Lokesh
Chandra, must be placed in question.

lacks the offerings below, or rather in front of the figure, which
are clearly seen in Fig. 6b.
Further differences are to be made out when one compares
Icon 374 in the Tachikawa edition (Fig. 7b), equivalent to our
376, with the corresponding drawing 880 in the Chandra edition
(Fig. 7a). What is most striking is the lack of precision of detail in
Fig. 7a: the figures are only sketchily drawn; arms and legs and
even the individual faces of the secondary figures are sometimes
scarcely recognizable, or details such as the breasts of secondary
figures or the three jewels in front of the principal figure are
clumsily represented.
Similar differences can also be seen when one compares Fig. 8c
with Fig. 8 d.
In 1995 Musashi Tachikawa, Masahide Mori and Shinobu Ya-
maguchi published a set of the Icons that is located at the Indian
Institute of the University of Hamburg. On the origin of this set,
however, the editors provide no information. A. Terentiev, re-
viewing the Tachikawa et al. publication in Indo-Iranian Journal,
mentions another three copies, two in St Petersburg and one in
Ulan-Ude. 11
Of these sets of the Icons Worthwhile to See known today!2 we
had available for more detailed analysis two editions in facsim-
ile (Chandra and Tachikawa editions) and one other partly from
the original and partly from tracings (Peter edition).13 In addi-
tion, reproductions of most of the icons can be found in Lokesh
Chandra's Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary (Lokesh Chandra 1959-61);
we shall see, however, that these by no means comprise a uniform
set
If one compares the Chandra edition with that of Tachikawa et
al., several differences stand out. For example, in the two editions
the mantras are arranged differently. In the Tachikawa edition
the mantras regularly fill a rectangular area (Fig. 4b), whereas
in the Chandra edition (Fig. 4a) they are organized into a left-
hand and a right-hand block with the open field in the center
displaying only five seed-syllables written one above the other
- which are incidentally not in lantsha script as they are in the
Tachikawa edition. It is also noticeable that the rectangles round
the figures and mantras clearly have different proportions: those
in the Tachikawa edition are almost square, those in the Chandra
edition elongated.
But the individual drawings also display quite considerable
differences, as for example a comparison of no. 23 (Kanaka-vatsa)
shows: in the Chandra edition (Fig. 5 a) the saint is dominant in
the center, while in the Tachikawa edition (Fig. 5b) he is shifted
towards the left side of the picture, to give the secondary figure
more room. (Ignore Fig. 5c for the moment. The branch of the
tree above the saint displays in Fig. 5a only little rosettes of leaves,
which look like flowers, while in Fig. 5b it bears many leaves.
The differences are still more obvious when Icons 115-117 in
the Tachikawa edition and their counterparts in the Chandra
edition are compared with each other. Especially striking are the
different flower-tendrils to the right and left of the body nimbus
in Fig. 6a and b: in Fig. 6a, the S-shape of the tendrils, which
stands out very clearly in Fig. 6b, is not visible at all. Fig. 6a also
Status of the Chandra edition
On these pictures something leaps to the eye that also stands
out on other pages: the widespread absence of the characteristic
features of woodblock prints in the Chandra edition.
If one compares Tibetan depictions of deities drawn freehand
with ones that have been printed with woodblocks, what stands
out most is the different course of the individual lines: lines drawn
freehand are-in the case of a good draftsman-regular, which
does not mean they are always the same thickness. The line
thickness can alter--and indeed with good artists it does alter
frequently-namely, from a fine initial line to a thick line and back
to a fine line, so that the line thickness changes continually. In
contrast to this, the course of a line in a blockprint is often irregular
and coarse and changes abruptly, and not infrequently there are
breaks in the course of the line, as well as blurred-looking places,
where the block or the ink was unable to ink the paper or could
do so only faintly. Above all, the squares framing the figures are,
in the case of blockprints, relatively untidy and frayed, whereas
frames drawn by hand are fine and regular. In the margin of
blockprints one frequently sees a kind of 'shadow', dirty places
where the printing block was inadvertently inked and printed.
The characteristics of woodblock prints mentioned here are not
to be found in the Chandra edition, so that it becomes obvious
that the Chandra edition in contrast to the Tachikawa edition-
reproduces not so much a woodblock print as a set of drawings.
These drawings appear to be loosely based on the standard
blockprint (as reproduced in the Tachikawa edition), but differing

in their proportions and in many details, they can hardly be
called a copy of it by Western standards. The clumsiness of their
execution has already been noted: with John Huntington, we
must suppose that the Chandra edition 'was copied or redone in
a hasty, not very nice way.'15 Whatever its exact nature and origin,
we shall refer to the drawings reproduced in the Chandra edition
of the Icons as 'Chandra A'.
On the basis of the foregoing explanation, therefore, the claim
of Lokesh Chandra that the edition published by him was of a
xylographic edition acquired by his father in Ulan Bator in 1956
becomes very questionable. Asked about the discrepancy, Lokesh
Chandra has only increased the confusion, as in a letter to me dated
29 June 1993 he speaks of three versions belonging to him: '(i) A
photocopy of the print at Leningrad, bought by my father in 1955
.... (ii) Original xylographic print from a friend ... (iii) Xerox of
Lessing's copy with his notes.' There is no reference to the version
redrawn by hand that served as an original for A New Tibeto-
Mongol Pantheon and Buddhist Iconography. It is also unclear why
all of a sudden he is no longer talking about an original woodblock
print from Ulan Bator but about a photocopy of Leningrad print
obtained in 1955.16
Now we have already mentioned that, prior to the first complete
'Chandra edition of Icons Worthwhile to See in 1963-4, Lokesh
Chandra had already published many icons from Icons Worthwhile
to See in 1959-61 in his Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary. Examination
reveals that these illustrations derive from three quite different
sets.
In the first two volumes (KA-KHA)- which differ from the
rest of the Dictionary in that all the text is handwritten-all the
illustrations from Icons Worthwhile to See are from the Chandra A
drawings, except four, which are from tracings of the standard
blockprint.
In the remaining ten volumes (with typeset text), most of
the Icons Worthwhile to See illustrations are from the standard
blockprint. Towards the end, however, there are seven icons
from another set of drawings, which we shall call 'Chandra
B'. These are immediately recognizable by their markedly taller
format (height:width = 1.19), and are drawn with skill and
assurance (Fig. 8 a-b). They are so evidently superior to Chandra
A compare for instance with Fig. 8c) one wonders why they were
not preferred for the Pantheon. Perhaps the set is only fragmentary,
or perhaps they are tracings from drawings otherwise unsuitable
for reproduction and it would have taken too long to trace the
whole set.
Among the Dictionary illustrations from the standard block-
print, the means of reproduction varied. In the third volume (GA),
half-tone blocks were tried, with unsatisfactory results. These
gave way to line blocks prepared from blockprint impressions.
As the work progressed, the impressions were increasingly re-
touched, in the interests of clarity, until in later volumes it is plain
that the illustrations were being reproduced from tracings. These
tracings, presumably done specially for the Dictionary, are of good
quality (Fig. 5c).
Given the lack of evidence that the drawings Chandra A and
Chandra B ever existed as blockprints, it is not clear that either set
is included in the 'three versions' of Icons Worthwhile to See listed
by Lokesh Chandra in his letter quoted above.
Had the redrawn line drawings of Chandra A not been pub-
lished, there would have been no need to go into them in such
detail. However, as they have been published-not just once but
at least twice-and in the course of that the impression has been
given that they were reproductions of Tibetan original prints, this
full discussion has been appropriate and indeed necessary.
The Zürich painted version: freehand drawings or
blockprints?
When we compare the version of the Völkerkundemuseum der
Universität Zürich, which is reproduced in the present work,
with both the Chandra edition and the Tachikawa edition, even
a superficial comparison yields the supposition that the Zürich
version corresponds to the Tachikawa edition. This supposition
becomes certainty when we carry out a detailed investigation.
On the verso sides, the Völkerkundemuseum's copy shows
unambiguously the characteristics of the Tachikawa edition men-
tioned above: the mantras (see Figs 3 and 4b above) regularly
fill the squared-off area, and in addition are not, as in the Chan-
dra edition (see Fig. 4 a), divided into a left-hand and a right-
hand block, while furthermore the five seed-syllables one above
the other are written in lantsha script. The rectangles in the two
editions (Tachikawa and Zürich) also have exactly the same pro-
portions and the type area in the two is just the same size.
If we compare the drawings of the Tachikawa edition with the

paintings of the Zürich version on the recto sides, at once the
countless correspondences stand out. All the same, in certain
pictures there are also important differences. Thus, for exam-
ple, behind the nimbus in picture 241, in the Tachikawa edition
(Fig. 9 a) blossoms and fruit with relatively large leaves can be
discerned, whereas in the Zürich copy (Fig. 9b) the leaves are
scale-like and very regularly arranged and no blossoms or fruit
can be seen between them.
The lotus flowers that serve as a throne for the Buddha are in the
Tachikawa edition framed with large leaves, while in the Zürich
copy these leaves are entirely absent.
On the basis of these quite clear-cut divergences, are the two
versions then not identical? In order to be able to answer this
question, the folio with Icons 241-243 (Zürich copy) was illu-
minated with a powerful lamp from underneath, on the princi-
ple that by this means the original drawing, subsequently over-
painted, would become visible. The result was amazing: where
green meadows were painted, lines appeared, which without fur-
ther ado emerged as drawings of leaves (Icon 241) (Fig. 10) or of
mountains and water (Icons 242-243).
An exact comparison of the drawings brought to light in the
Zürich copy with the drawings in the Tachikawa edition reveals
that we have here completely identical drawings. When greatly
enlarged details from the two versions are juxtaposed (Figs 11-13),
this correspondence can be easily seen.
The divergences of the Zürich painted edition in relation to
the Tachikawa edition are therefore proven to be the artistic
freedom of the painter, who has in these instances not kept to the
pattern, but through his individual style of painting has given the
paintings a personal touch. These are the limited freedoms of the
Tibetan painter, which can indeed only superficially be described
as freedoms, since even in the Zürich version the painter was by
no means allowed to give his imagination free rein. He could
simply choose those he liked best from the repertoire of tree and
landscape depictions familiar in his time. The freedom of the
artist is therefore a freedom of selection from an already given set
of possibilities and not one of completely new creation.
The correspondences between the two versions-three if we
include Peter's copy from Ladakh, which I have been able to
examine only in part-are only explicable if we start from the
assumption that the copies here under discussion all come from
one and the same set of blocks or else were traced with the aid of
one and the same set of templates and then drawn freehand.
We can rule out freehand drawings, if we call to mind what
we said earlier about the characteristics of woodblock prints: the
lines of the mantras on the verso side, as well as those of the
drawing made visible by transmitted light in paintings 241-3 of
the Zürich copy (see Figs 3, 10 and 11-13), proceed irregularly.
The line thickness of the drawing on the recto varies, as does the
thickness of the lines that frame the mantras. In the course of
the lines there are breaks and dirty, messy places. In addition,
as has already been demonstrated (Figs 11-13), correspondences
exist between the line drawings of Icons 241-243 of the Tachikawa
edition and the Zürich version right down to the smallest details.
Equally, superimposing Figs 3 and 4b shows that the placement
and form of each letter of the mantras on the verso agree exactly
between the two versions. Therefore not only must both recto and
verso sides be based on impressions of woodblocks, but both the
Tachikawa and the Zürich copies were printed from one and the
same set of blocks. The same applies to the Peter copy, as already
becomes clear when the icons reproduced in his article in JRAS are
compared exactly with the corresponding icons in the Tachikawa
or the Zürich versions.
To sum up, we can say that there was definitely used as starting
material for the four volume work before us a complete set of
folios, on the front sides of which were printed the figures and on
the reverse sides the mantras belonging to them.
The Tibetan inscriptions in the left-hand page margins and in
the lower margin of each icon are also elements of the original
print. They concern the name of the work to which the pictures
belong, as for example Rin-'byun, and the page number (left
margin); and the name of the icon (lower margin of picture).
These inscriptions are placed just where the yellow color of the
picture margin covers up the corresponding printed inscription.
In certain places the original printed text still shows through.
This is not the case with the Mongolian writing in the right-hand
margin of each icon, thus it must be assumed that the original
print did not include any Mongolian writing, and consequently
this was written in addition as an amendment of the model.

Support and ground of the pictures
An analysis carried out in the laboratory of the Schweizerisches
Landesmuseum established that for the support of the characters
on the reverse side and also of the figures on the recto side was
used a paper consisting of very fine bast fibers (up to 12 um
in diameter). The papers glued on to the back of the picture
support also all consisted of bast fibers, but these were coarser
than those in the picture support. In all probability bast fibers
from the Thymelæaceæ family (probably a species of Daphne, the
genus including spurge laurel and mezereon) were used for the
manufacture of the paper.
At a defective place in the margin of the picture, beneath the
outer colored frame-lines lies a white layer of white lead. This
was first of all interpreted as the ground, and assumed therefore
to cover the entire painting area. Closer examination revealed,
however, that the white detected in the marginal area is restricted
to that area, probably mainly to give adhesion to the yellow
organic pigment. Despite an intensive search for a ground also
present in the picture area, none could be detected. From this it
can be concluded that the handmade page, printed on the back
with mantras and on the front with the icons, was painted on
directly, i.e., without a ground. In all probability the reverse side
was reinforced with several layers of paper before painting-which
covered up the text. In the course of this gluing process the paper
that serves as the picture support became saturated with glue,
which would explain why putting an additional ground on the
recto side was unnecessary.
to compare a large number of Tibetan paintings that indubitably
come from one and the same studio.
Hitherto only relatively few Tibetan paintings have been sub-
jected to precise analysis of the colors. For the present publication,
the colors of one folio, namely, the one with Icons 241-243, were
investigated by Annette Meier of the laboratory of the Schweiz-
erisches Landesmuseum in Zürich. The places from which Mrs
Meier took samples were in every case so small that the amount
could scarcely be seen with the naked eye. The material was inves-
tigated microchemically in combination with microscopic optical
observations. Here and there, X-ray diffraction analysis was also
applied.
The analysis of the colors yielded the following results (sum-
marized in the table opposite).
For the green used in some pictures for the landscape, emerald
green (copper aceto-arsenite) was employed. For lighter shades
of green, the pigment was used more finely divided, i.e., ground
finer than in the strong green color; in the lightest green, however,
a white (white lead) was added. This dominant use of emerald
green is quite atypical for Tibetan paintings, in which malachite
principally serves for the production of green colors.18
As the blue for the dark blue sky, azurite of mineral origin was
used. It was ground moderately fine, with a grain size of 10-35 um.
Most were around 10 um. Here again, in the lighter shades of blue
the azurite is more finely divided than in the dark blue color of
the sky and the lightest blue has in addition been mixed with a
white (white lead). In the blue-green of the trees behind Icon 242
azurite and a green-in all probability also emerald green--are
represented. The blue-green of the marginal stripe is composed
of emerald green and artificial ultramarine.
As an additional blue, for the border of the clouds or sky, an
almost blue-black pigment was used. This is indigo. It was
applied over the sky color for glazing. Indigo was also employed
for modeling, for example on the grass, and likewise in other
places.
The red color of the marginal stripes consists of cinnabar. The
cinnabar is uniform in grain size (with stronger magnification,
definite transparent particles can be made out) and of a beautiful
shade. It is not discernible whether the cinnabar is of mineral
origin. On the basis of the fact that the cinnabar can dissolve very
rapidly in aqua regia, according to Meier it is probably synthetic
The colors
Unquestionably, the greatest value of the present collection of the
Icons Worthwhile to See lies in the fact that it is a painted version.
Besides the figurative elements, coloration is known to be of de-
cisive importance for the characterization and classification of a
deity in the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon. Since uncertainty reigns
over the actual appearance of a deity when it is known only on
the basis of an outline drawing and/or a written description, the
present collection with 510 painted figures is therefore especially
valuable: thanks to it the actual appearance is reliably and un-
ambiguously recorded and made known not merely for one deity,
but for an entire pantheon of 510 deities and holy beings. Thanks
to this compendium, moreover, it is for the first time possible

cinnabar. The same pigment served for the red subdividing lines
and the red robes
According to Jackson & Jackson (1984: 81), Tibetan painters
used the pure orange varieties of minium (red lead) and not
the red or scarlet shades. This is also the case in the paintings
investigated here, where for example the under-robe of the
Buddhas (Icons 241-243) is colored in this way.
The yellow color occurs only in the wide frame areas and
presumably as an admixture with the skin colors. The coloring
pigment could not be identified. It is merely settled that it is a
yellow organic pigment, but not, however, Indian yellow. The
yellow of the frame areas is accompanied by white lead. One
cannot, however, definitely tell whether the yellow was mixed
with the white lead or whether the yellow was first underlain with
a white ground and this then colored irregularly by overpainting.
The white areas such as clouds and lotus flowers consist only
of lead white. This is untypical for Tibetan paintings, in which
chalk is usually used. No other white could be detected, and in
the colors mixed with white also only lead white was found.
True black was used only for painting the internal markings
of the hilly landscapes and the hair of peaceful deities. It was a
carbon black, containing particles of 2-8 um. Certain microscopic
structures suggest it may be a vegetable black.
Gold was applied richly for embellishment or modeling. The
sun and moon in the sky are likewise painted in this color. It was
established that real gold powder was used for this. The use of
silver could not be demonstrated, although the metal sometimes
appeared more golden and in other places more silvery, an effect
apparently created through the underlying color.
tation has often been called an 'Assembly Tree'.20 These tshogs-zin,
however, never display the same complexity and wealth of fig-
ures that we meet in the present work, and also their faithfulness
to detail is not to be compared with that of the present work, not
least because the individual figures in the tshogs-zin depictions are
as a rule significantly smaller than the individual figures in the
Icons Worthwhile to See.
The painted Icons Worthwhile to See is also a rarity on account of
its artistic quality. Without doubt this already strikes a superficial
observer, but only analysis of the details demonstrates with what
precision the Zürich set is painted. So as to recognize this, we
shall in the following show some details.
Body nimbuses
The rays coming from individual figures are painted with such
fineness that each individual ray performs a wave motion, which
is taken over by the next ray, so that the figures seem to radiate
a harmonious aura of light (Fig. 14). When this aura of light is
interrupted, for example by an emblem of the deity, the individual
rays end with great precision about a millimeter away from this
object so that they never touch it.
Ornaments, hair and faces
The ornaments on the clothing, the drawing of the hands and faces
(Fig. 15), decorations such as for example those on the saddlecloth
in Fig. 16, and even the hair of the mounts (Fig. 16), as well as the
tiniest details, such as the small heads, measuring 2-3 mm, in Icon
203 (Fig. 17) are also of masterly refinement.
Also painted with virtuosity is the blazing hair of the wrathful
deities (Fig. 18): the gaps between the separate wavy strands
of hair are very even, and approximately every eight strands
form single tufts of hair, which are separated from each other
by regularly increasing spaces. In comparison with this, the
black hair of the peaceful deities (Fig. 19) appears rather coarsely
painted, as with black hair the separate strands of hair can in
no case be distinguished. In quite a number of icons too, the
clouds, as well as the halos of flames (Fig. 20), give evidence
of comparatively little skill: in many places they are somewhat
clumsy, and sometimes appear almost provincially painted. This
variable quality of painting no doubt indicates that several hands
have labored on the work, as is not infrequently the case with
Tibetan paintings.
'Worthwhile to See'-an appreciation of the painting
The four-volume work to hand constitutes an exceptional rarity
in terms of both art history and religious studies. Firstly because,
as already mentioned, it is the only known painted copy of the
Icons Worthwhile to See; and in addition, because up to now no
other complete, painted, Tibetan Buddhist pantheons have been
known, disregarding the relatively common depictions on scroll
paintings (than-ka) of the so-called 'Gathering Field' (tshogs-zin,
'field (of holy beings, visualized) for the gathering (of merits)).
This is a tree on which sits a clearly defined pantheon of Buddhas,
deities and holy beings, which is why in the West such a represen-

Trees, hand-emblems
As examples particularly worthy of mention for fine painting in
gold, let us point to Fig. 21 (the drawing of different kinds of
leaves in the trees of Icon 197) and to Fig. 22. The various living
things in the deity's hands have been painted in gold paint with
unbelievable skill, including a lion in the upper right hand, an
elephant in the next hand, and a human being in the lower left
hand (Fig. 22 a,b).
Mounting
Whereas purely Tibetan books are composed of loose leaves lying
one on top of another between two wooden covers, the whole then
being held together by a cloth wrapper, this work stands out by a
manner of mounting the paintings, as well as of joining the pages,
that is rarely met with.
As already mentioned, the original pages, printed on in front
and behind and painted on the front side, had several layers of
paper stuck onto the reverse side, which lends them great stability.
Subsequently each separate folio, size 9 x 25 cm, was mounted in
a frame manufactured from cardboard, size 10.7 x 29 cm. Each
frame was covered on both sides with claret cloth, so that two
folios could be mounted in a single frame, lying back to back.
The separate elements of the page, consisting of a frame and two
strips of pictures (comprising three icons each) mounted in it back
to back, were joined together by means of fabric, paper and glue.
The result is a book bound concertina-fashion with pictures on
both sides. Boards of wood covered with fabric serve as book
covers and are joined to the outermost page on both sides of the
volume.
The ingenious method of assembly and binding of the sepa-
rately mounted pages is represented in Fig. 23.
Each volume numbers 21 double-sided folios, i.e., 42 strips
of three icons, which makes 126 icons. In the first and last
volumes is added one single-sided folio with three pictures, in
the first volume the frontispiece of Je Tsongk'a-pa and his two
chief disciples, in the fourth volume the closing folio with the two
Vajrabhairavas and Yamāri. Altogether the work thus numbers
510 icons.
Errors and deviations
'Although the painter seems to have been thoroughly famil-
iar with lamaistic traditions, and writes Tibetan and Mongolian
names correctly and fluently, he commits a considerable number
of quite inexplicable mistakes,' wrote Peter in his expert report.
In fact, the work exhibits a number of errors, of which only a few
will be mentioned here by way of example, as all deviations will
be listed in detail at the end of the description of each separate
icon, under the heading 'Deviations'.21 While many mistakes are
small and insignificant, there are also more important ones to be
discerned, which are all the more astonishing as sometimes they
involve very well known characteristics.
Thus, for example, Avalokita in illustration 104 wears no deer
(or antelope) skin over the left shoulder, and in illustrations 105
and 107 no deerskin lower garment, although this constitutes an
important identifying feature of this deity. In picture 236, Manjusri
Nāga-raksasa is painted without the nine snakes' heads typical of
this deity.
Here and there also, the artist has not kept accurately to the
directions as to color. Thus Padma-nartêśvara (58) is painted
yellow instead of red, Kālacakra's legs (72) are not white and red,
Maitri's Däkini (78) does not have black hair, and the special form
of Avalokita (130) deviates completely from the description as far
as the colors and expressions of the faces are concerned.22
As will be shown later (see the introduction to the Narthang
Gyatsa), in the Narthang Gyatsa section the illustrations depart
markedly from the text a number of times. It looks as if the artist
lacked a text of the Narthang Gyatsa to refer to.
Dating
It proves extremely hard to date the work. We do know that the
printing blocks from which the patterns for the present edition
were printed were carved shortly after 1810.23 But it is still quite
open whether this painted version also comes from that period.
The colors are quite bright, which in the case of Tibetan paint-
ings, such as scroll paintings (than-ka), can be, but is not necessar-
ily, an indication of modest age. But considering that hardly any
light would have fallen on the paintings, as the work would have
been stored closed, comparison with than-kas, which are normally
exposed to a certain incidence of light, and whose colors conse-
quently change greatly, is inadmissible.

Introduction
23
The fabric with which the book covers are trimmed also enables
no exact dating, as it is assigned to the Ch'ing Dynasty, which
embraces a very long period (1644 to 1912). Let us note all the same
that the way the covers are made is reminiscent of the presentation
typical of Tibetan and Mongolian canonical texts in Peking in the
18th and 19th centuries.24 In theory an older fabric, which did not
come from the same time as the paintings, might have been used
to trim the book covers, but this is relatively unlikely.
The colors used in the work also bring us little farther with
the question of dating. All the same, it is known that the very
frequently used emerald green was first manufactured in 1814.25
The work must therefore have been painted after 1814. A time of
around 1850 is possible. The wooden boards beneath the fabric
are of a tropical wood, which unfortunately cannot be dated by
dendrochronology.

Notes to the Introduction
1. Inv. no. 17942.
2. See for example Timmermann (1986), Plate VI below; National Mu-
seum of History (1977), pp. 76, 77.
3. The first folio with the illustration of Je Tsongk'a-pa (rle Tson-kha-
pa) and his two disciples bears the indication above, head', so that
the actual numbering with 1 begins on the second folio. The first
volume bears the Chinese numbers 1 to 42, the second volume 43 to
84, the third volume 85 to 126, and the fourth volume 127 to 169. The
numerals are of the quite unusual commercial type, see Needham &
Ronan (1981), Table 19, column H.
4. On the inside of the covers of Volumes 2, 3 and 4.
5. Pleated (i.e. concertina-style, or fan-folded) volumes are known in
China, in contrast with Tibet. See Fuchs (1966:21ff). Such concertina-
style volumes are also widespread in Burma and are sometimes to be
found in Nepal too.
6. See the Colophon to the blockprint, p. 208 below.
7. Interestingly, the version reproduced by Grünwedel also displays
Mongolian inscriptions to the right of each picture. It is unclear
whether they belong to the blockprint or were added by hand
(Grünwedel 1970: 9).
8. Besides this collection of 510 icons, other pantheons are known;
however, they too are known only as line drawings or as woodblock
prints. See for example Pander (1890); Oldenburg (1903); Clark (1937);
Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra (1961–72), other parts; Olschak &
Wangyal (1973).
9. The whereabouts of the photographs of the entire Rinjung Gyatsa,
Narthang Gyatsa and Vajrávali, which ought to be at Harvard, are also
unclear according to oral information from John Huntington.
10. Lokesh Chandra apparently counts A New Tibeto-Mongol Pantheon
(Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra 1961-72) as the first edition of his
iconographic compendium, the Japanese edition entitled Buddhist
Iconography of Tibet (Lokesh Chandra 1986) as the second, and the
Indian reprint Buddhist Iconography (Lokesh Chandra 1988) as the
third. The last seems to be identical to the second apart from the
omission of the Japanese notes and index.
11. Terentiev, Andrey: Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. 40 (1997), 165-6.
12. To sum up, the following copies still exist with certainty: Indian
Institute, University of Hamburg, here called the Tachikawa edition;
Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, Dharamsala (not published);
Lokesh Chandra, New Delhi (several sets, see main text; in this In-
troduction we call the version published in 1963 4 and 1986/88 the
Chandra edition); Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich, two copies
(2°L.tibet.6q: copy which belonged to Albert Grünwedel; 2°L.tibet.or:
copy which belonged to F.A. Peter, sNar-than section missing); Mu-
seum of the History of Religions, St Petersburg, Institute of Oriental
Studies, St Petersburg; Ulan-Ude, Buryatia (address not given); hand-
drawn copy of F.A. Peter, present whereabouts unknown.
13. A comparison between the Tachikawa and Chandra editions does
reveal, as we shall see later, stylistic and artistic differences; the order
of the individual pictures, however, is identical in the two editions.
A numerical correlation for the purposes of comparison proves to be
not altogether straightforward, as Lokesh Chandra's collection begins
with number 511 and ends with number 1009, which suggests simply
single-picture numbering; but in two places he has used the same
numbers twice (nos. 636 and 792-4), and in two more a folio bears
only one number instead of three (nos. 813 and 925). Comparison
of our regular numbering from 1 to 510 with the numbering used
by Clark (1937) and Peter (1943) is also not straightforward, as they
number the folios and label the three pictures on one folio with a b
and c respectively. Tachikawa et al. use a numbering system similar
to ours, but departing slightly from it from Icon 307 onwards because
they give this number (and later 419) to a triptych of three icons.
These numbering systems have been included in the plate captions,
to facilitate reference, and a full concordance is provided among the
reference materials.

edition

lished by Lokesh Chandra in 1964, without, however, going into the

inconsistencies and questions explained here.
17. The papers react strongly positive on the lodine/KI test, as does the
sheet that was printed on in front and behind and serves as the ground
for painting. The positive detection of starch is to be ascribed either
to the adhesive or to sizing of the paper with starch, or presumably
to both at once.
18. See Jackson & Jackson, 1984: 78-79.
19. That the minium definitely had no red shade surprised Mrs Meier,
who carried out the investigation, as this is unfamiliar in the European
sphere.
20. The appellation 'Assembly Tree', though descriptive, is not a valid
translation of the Tibetan tshogs-zin: Tibetan sources (e.g. Bte) are clear
that the second part of the word is žin, 'field', not sin, 'tree', and that
tshogs refers to the gathering of merits rather than the assembly of
holy persons
21. The listing of deviations in the Translations section is conservative:
the editor has given the artist the benefit of all reasonable doubt as to
whether a feature should have been visible to him on the small-scale
photographic copy of the MS (each picture approximately 26 mm
square) used for checking. Thus the absence of items that could
be construed as hidden, those it would have been impracticable (or
simply contrary to convention) for the artist to portray, and those
that might not have shown up on the photographs because of small
scale or a white background, is ignored, and features indistinct on the
photographs have been assumed to be correct unless he was confident
they were not.
22. F.A. Peter wrote in his report: 'Stranger yet is that while the painter
generally follows the color indications the blockprint gives for various
figures, e.g. a small s for ser-po, i.e. yellow, or a small m for dmar-po, i.e.
red, etc., at times these have been disregarded altogether and other
colors used, even though the indications are still visible under the
-paint. Despite intensive efforts, we have not been able to discover
the color indications that Peter was referring to in the copy of Icons
Worthwhile to See before us.
23. Lokesh Chandra 1986: 51-52; Peter 1943: 16ff.
24. Lange 1966. For a similar but finer, more costly and probably older
fabric, see the brocade-covered dedication page from a Tibetan book
in: Essen & Thingo (1989): Plates Vol., 57, which is connected with
the Manchu emperor Chia-ch'ing (1796-1820) (portrayed to the right
of the page), the same one who gave instructions for the production
of the Icons Worthwhile to See. Two other book covers, covered with a
similar brocade, are in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich (Cod.-
tibet.634 and 635; both illustrated in Grönbold 1991: 136-139).

Notes on the Captions
For each icon of the reproduction of the Zürich manuscript of the
Bris-sku mthon-ba don-ldan below, we give the following informa-
tion on the facing page.
1. The serial number by which we refer to the icon throughout
the present work.
2. In bold, the translation of the Tibetan caption. In accordance
with established usage among English-speaking scholars and
practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism, the basic name of each deity
of Indian origin is given in Sanskrit, but secondary elements
such as 'Red', 'Four-armed', and so forth are translated into
English whenever appropriate (though a Sanskrit equivalent may
be given as well if this is judged helpful). When it is necessary
to retain a Tibetan name, it is represented in a rough phonetic
transcription, as Tibetan spelling, with its many silent letters, is
very confusing to those who have not studied the language. Those
who have will of course prefer the exact transliteration; this too is
provided throughout the book (see, for example, the next item),
and separately indexed.
3. In italics, the transcription of the Tibetan caption. Some errors
in the original have been corrected in these transcriptions.
4. A transcription of the Mongolian caption, introduced by 'M:'.
These captions sometimes use native Mongolian words, some-
times loan-words from Sanskrit or Chinese, and sometimes merely
a phonetic transcription of the Tibetan. Different occurrences of
the same deity are not always treated similarly.
For these transcriptions we are indebted to Lissi Roth, Hans
Roth and Prof. Michael Weiers of Bonn. However, the Mongolian
script is very ambiguous and we have sometimes amended their
work for the sake of consistency.
5. A translation of the Mongolian caption may follow, in paren-
theses. If it does not, it may be taken that the Mongolian is equiva-
lent to the Tibetan. When there is a difference, it is usually a matter
of the Mongolian caption having been abbreviated--sometimes
necessary in order to fit it into the limited space available. A
dagger (f) indicates that the caption is erroneous.
There are some consistent features of the Mongolian that it
would be tedious to note every time. The most striking is that the
name of almost every female deity is followed by eke, 'mother',
e.g., Dhar-a eke, literally Mother Tārā'. (This does not apply to the
names including the word Iha-mo, 'goddess', which is translated as
ökin tngri, 'heavenly maiden'.) On the other hand, the Mongolian
invariably omits the word 'tradition' (lugs in Tibetan), e.g., no. 4,
White Tārā in the tradition of Atīša, is simply 'Atīša's White Tārā'
in the Mongolian
27

6. If the basic deity of which this is a form is not named explicitly
in the caption, the name is given, e.g., Simha-nāda (131): Form of
Avalokita.
7. If the icon depicts only an attendant rather than the principal
deity of a sadhana, this is stated. If the subject is presented in the
source text as a member of a named group, this is indicated too.
E.g., Angaja (17): One of Sixteen Elders / Attendant of 16.
8. Xyl.' ('Xylograph') introduces references to the standard
blockprint and the Chandra drawings based on it. The first
number is the page reference as cited by Clark (Two Lamaistic
Pantheons, Pantheon C), Lokesh Chandra (Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictio-
nary) and Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra (A New Tibeto-Mongol
Pantheon, Parts 8-9). After a comma is added the serial num-
ber from Lokesh Chandra, Buddhist Iconography, 3rd edition (1988)
(also applicable to the 1986 edition), and after a semicolon that
from Tachikawa et al. (1995). It will be noted that the numbering
in Lokesh Chandra (1986, 1988) is incorrect, some numbers being
allocated twice, while both Lokesh Chandra and Tachikawa et al.
allocate single numbers to two triptychs (307-9, 421-3).
9. 'TSD' introduces the page or pages in Lokesh Chandra's
Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary on which the corresponding icon is
reproduced. A dagger (1) indicates that the icon is not correctly
identified in the accompanying text. The source of each repro-
duction is indicated as (X) for the standard blockprint, (A) for the
Chandra A drawings (as later published in Buddhist Iconography),
and (B) for the drawings from Chandra B. In the case of the block-
print images, the mode of reproduction also often has a dramatic
effect, so this too is generally indicated: X, denotes a half-tone
direct from the blockprint, Xa line block direct from the block-
print or from a retouched copy, and X, a line block from a tracing
of the blockprint. X, and X, cannot always be distinguished with
certainty, when this is so the mode subscript is omitted.
10. For the more complex images, a key to the deities is provided,
in the form of an array of identification letters in a small square
box. The letters refer to the text in Section Two, but enable visible
features to be looked up straight from the Index when desired,
without having to go via the text.

Dedicatory verses to Part One,
by the Fourth Panchen Rinpoche
From the blockprint!
OM SVASTI!
These pictures of the Jewel Mine (= Rinjung) sādhana deities,
The mere sight, und or thought of which will free
From all the failings of samsāra and Nirvana,
Easily grant any realization you want.
Through the merit of making them, may all who helped
Provide the needful conditions—the patrons and
Two kinds of artists and craftsmen traverse in order
The Stages and Paths, and quickly win Omniscience!
Meanwhile, may they have long life, health and happiness,
And by the force of merit from offering and
Requests to the highest of Fields, may all their aims
Come about without effort, of themselves!
MANGALAM!

Dedicatory verses to Part Two,
by the Fourth Paņchen Rinpoche
From the blockprint!
OM SVASTI!
These pictures of the Narthang Gyatsa deities,
The mere sight, sound or thought of which will free
From all the failings of samsāra and Nirvāna,
Easily grant any realization you want.
Through the merit of making them, may all who helped
Provide the needful conditions-the patrons and
Two kinds of artists and craftsmen traverse in order
The Stages and Paths, and quickly win Omniscience!
Meanwhile, may they have long life, health and happiness,
And by the force of merit from offering and
Requests to the highest of Fields, may all their aims
Come about without effort, of themselves!
MANGALAM!

Dedicatory verses to Part Three,
by the Fourth Panchen Rinpoche
From the blockprint
OM SVASTI!
These pictures of the Vajrávalī mandalas are
From Abhayākara, who explained the Sage's doctrine
Realizing well the truth of the ocean of Tantra,
The highest of all the Sage's excellent teachings.
Through the merit of making them, may all who helped
Provide the needful conditions the patrons and
Two kinds of artists and craftsmen—traverse in order
The Stages and Paths, and quickly win Omniscience!
Meanwhile, may they have long life, health and happiness,
And by the force of merit from offering and
Requests to the highest of Fields, may all their aims
Come about without effort, of themselves!
MANGALAM!

Ordained and lay, received the four empowerments.
In the fifteenth year of Emperor Chia-ch'ing's reign,
With his treasurer, Losang Könch'ok, and
Chingwang P'ünts'ok Dorje and his sons
And ministers, Noyan Trülku Ratnavajra
Made request of the Fourth [Panchen) Incarnate,
The manifestation of Krsnacārin, come
To this northern land, to introduce fortunate beings
Into the Adibuddha's great mandala,
Bestowing th' empowerment of entering like a child,
The higher empowerment and the very high,
And the great empowerment of the Vajra Master.
On this occasion, led by the patrons mentioned,
The two High Abbots, Ilayuysan and
Nom-un qayan, Tā Lama and officials
Such as stewards, provosts and precentors,
Pad-li Gung and Jasay Taiji, with
Their wives and ministers, and hundreds of others,
So that the supreme guides of sentient beings,
The Dalai and Panchen Lamas, Šibcundampa,
And other upholders of the Doctrine might
Live long, and all beings gain Enlightenment,
They then requested that blockprints be prepared
Of the Rinjung and the Narthang Gyatsas
And the mandalas of the Vajrávali.
Having received permission, the supervisors
Ch'ö-je K'edr'up and Gelong Ts'ering; the artists
Who drew the originals, Lozang Jinpa and
Lozang Trashi, Ngawang Sherap and
Lozang Ch'ödar and Lozang Ts'epak;
Block-cutters Erdeni Toyin, Ts'ering Trashi,
Gelong Ch'örap, Ch'öjor and others, and
The patrons, craftsmen and so forth did the work.

Erdeni Sečen Dalai, treasurer
Gönpo-kyap, Gung, Tā Lama and others 10
Urged the need for a prayer to bless the edition
To generate great assistance to Doctrine and beings.
In the face of this request, Lozang Pelden
Tenpei Nyima Ch'ok-le Namgyelll wrote it.
Through the merit, may the great Gelukpa school
Spread and flourish in all times and places!

Chandra's interpretation (Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra 1963–4: ix-
x). The division into verses is the translator's—in the style obligatory
for a Tibetan colophon, the original is all run together in a single,
absurdly complicated sentence!
2. The Manchu emperor Chia-ch'ing reigned from 1796 to 1820, thus the

5. According to Lokesh Chandra, implies the Kālacakra mandala.
6. mKhan-chen I-la-kog-san, No-min-han// gñis: Lokesh Chandra ignores
gris, 'two'. The second is mentioned separately in a later verse.
7. 'Stewards': gsol-mgron = gsol-dpon + mgron-gñer, originally stewards
responsible for food and for receiving guests; 'provost': dge-bskos,
monk in charge of the monastery's discipline; 'precentor': dbu-mdzad,
monk who leads the chanting.

Mantras from the reverse of the blockprints
As shown above in the Introduction, the mantras found on the
reverse side of the blockprints are also present, though hidden,
in the Zürich painted set. They are transcribed here from the
Tachikawa et al. (1995) edition of the blockprints (T), except
where this omits the relevant page of mantras, in which case a
label (A:)' indicates the Chandra A version (Buddhist Iconography,
1988) has been used. (This arises because in every case where a
folio was missing from the Hamburg copy, Tachikawa et al. have
inadvertently reproduced with the picture from the Dharamsala
copy the mantras from the preceding folio, thus duplicating some
folios' mantras and omitting others altogether.) The icon numbers
are our own, with the Tachikawa et al. number added in brackets
where their numbering (as regards the mantras) is incorrect.
Down the center of each panel of mantras run the syllables in
lantsha script:
OM
ĀH
HÜM
SWA
HA.
These, or at least the first three, are commonly written on the back
of a deity painting when it is consecrated, to imbue it with the
Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities and Activities of the Enlightened
Being it represents.
The spaces either side of the five syllables are filled usually with
seven lines (sometimes six, occasionally as few as five or as many
as ten) of text. Typically this begins with one or more mantras
of the deity or deities depicted. Unless there is insufficient space,
there then usually follows the Pratītya-samutpăda-hrdaya (Heart of
Dependent Arising), a much-revered verse from the scriptures
summarizing the Buddha's teaching:
YE DHARMA HETU-PRABHAWA
HETUN TEŞĀN TATHĀGATO HY AVADAT/
TEŠAN CA YO NIRODHA
EWAM-VĀDĪ MAHĀ-ŚRAMANAH.
Of dharmas, which arise from causes,
the Tathāgata has proclaimed the cause,
and their cessation,
the truth-telling Great Ascetic.
The misspellings prabhawa and dharma are frequent in this edition,
Here, the verse is not made into a mantra by adding om at the
beginning and swĀHĀ at the end, as is done in some practices.?
Any remaining space is filled with the consecration mantra OM
SU-PRATIŞTHA VAJRA YE SWĀHĀ, auspicious words (MANGALAM,
SARVA-MANGALAM, or ŚUBHAM) and occasionally BHAVANTU.
In the listing below, the extra mantras have been ignored and
only our icon number and the deity mantra or mantras appear.
Where there is more than one mantra, if they belong to different
deities the mantras are identified by letters corresponding to the
relevant key diagram, while if they are for the same deity they are
labeled with roman numerals.
As in Section II, we transcribe the Tibetan wa as w and ba as
B or V. The choice of B or V and the division into words (where
not shown by the punctuation) are made for clarity when the
words resemble Sanskrit. In the more garbled mantras these re-
semblances can be misleading. Some letters that are undoubtedly

nience, although the pictures themselves lack chapter divisions,
either in the paintings or the blockprints. Some sets of icons be-
longing to a single sadhana have also been indicated by group
subheadings.
wrong (as known from the textual sources) are transliterated in
lower case italics. Minor defects in the blocks, for example making
a pa look like a ba or vice versa, have been disregarded when the
correct reading is certain, as context almost always plays a part
in reading a Tibetan blockprint; vowel quantities, however, are
reproduced as printed.
The particle YE can in many mantras be inserted or omitted at
will, and is accordingly written separately in such cases, e.g. VAJRA
YE in the consecration mantra above.
Chapter headings from Section II have been added for conve-

II. Translations from the Source Texts



Translator's Introduction
we have cut such standardized passages and concentrated on
what is specific to individual deities.
Section 1 above presented the Zürich manuscript of the Icons
Worthwhile to See, a set of 510 miniature paintings of Tibetan
Buddhist deities. In this section we give translations from the
source texts on which those paintings were based. It may be used
either in conjunction with Section 1, or with other versions of the
Icons Worthwhile to See. The system of numbering refers directly
to the former, but concordance tables are provided to enable the
relevant plates to be found in the other published versions also.
The source texts comprise three collections of rites: the Rinjung
Gyatsa, the Narthang Gyatsa, and the Vajravali. The last is the oldest,
taking its name from the first of a trilogy of texts by the Indian
teacher Abhayākara-gupta (d. 1125), which describe the complete
mandalas of a number of prominent deities. Only the principal
deity of each mandala is illustrated in JWS, so here likewise we
confine ourselves to the details of the principals
The Northang Gyatsa is a cycle of thirty-three concise sādhanas
compiled in Tibet in the thirteenth century, though the component
practices are said to have been brought from India by Atīsa two
centuries before. We give these sådhanas in full as presented by a
seventeenth-century lama.
The bulk of the work, however, is devoted to the Rinjung Gyatsa,
comprising some three hundred practices gathered in the early
seventeenth century by Lama Tāranātha. Having received the
transmissions of these practices from many different teachers, he
arranged them in a cycle to encourage the continuation of their
lineages, many of which were rare and in danger of dying out. Not
surprisingly, this collection is quite heterogeneous. Nevertheless
there are sections of the sādhanas that repeat almost word for word
from one deity to another. As many of the sādhanas are quite long,
Approach
When I took on this project, in 1986, I was a Buddhist monk and
had spent most of the preceding ten years in study and practice
at monasteries and centers connected with the Gelukpa tradition.
Before that I was a physicist. My viewpoint therefore combines
the outlook of a Tibetan Buddhist practitioner, though a far from
accomplished one, with that of a Western scientist and scholar.
And of course, as a translator I have a professional interest in
the languages of the texts and in making sense of the names and
terminology and their variations.
As a scientist, I am curious about such questions as what
distinguishes these hundreds of deities one from another, what
they are for, and how they arose in such diversity. Like biological
species, deities have their natural history, ecology and evolution,
and as in biology, in relation to these fields taxonomy is an
indispensable tool, rather than an end in itself. The needs of deity
taxonomy are met by such simplified iconographic descriptions
as are presented in the Identification Guide below, but the wider
studies require more varied data-much of which are found in
the present texts, as I demonstrate by translating far more than
the bare descriptions.
As a practitioner, I must remain true to the tradition. To this
end, it is important to present the deities in their religious context
-again, not focusing narrowly on the iconography alone and
to avoid inauthenticity, any sort of twisting of the source material
to conform to preconceptions inconsistent with the tradition.

Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
Linguistically too, I see it as worthwhile to strive for authentic-
ity. Too many studies of Buddhist iconography have imposed on
their material ideas and terminology alien to Buddhism. Hindu
terms such as sakti (for a deity's female consort) and manufac-
tured, bogus terms such as 'dhyāni-buddha' and 'mānuși-buddha'
continue to be repeated, and one must suspect that where this
is the case, other, less obvious errors are likely to lurking
undiscovered. My suspicions increase when I find academic
works on Buddhist art and iconography in which the posture
names differ markedly from those in our sources-for example,
having āsana? appended to each name, and including names that
I have never seen in a Buddhist text but that are well known in
hatha-yoga.
In order to maintain authenticity, therefore, a degree of skep-
ticism towards conventions current in the field is necessary. A
generally accepted equivalence between a Tibetan term and its
visual portrayal, or between a Tibetan name and its supposed In-
dian original, may not be as well founded as one might think. All
too easily, one scholar's surmise can come down to the next gener-
ation as probable fact and to the one after as established wisdom,
enshrined in dictionaries and the like. The present project, bring-
ing a large collection of authentic pictorial material together with
its textual sources, allows many such assumptions to be tested.
The results of some such tests are given in the glossary.
The glossary and indexes, moreover, give the Tibetan and
(when a term occurs in Nişpanna-yogâvalī) Sanskrit forms as they
actually occur in the texts, with variations (apart from inflections
and evident errors)-neither simplified into a single idealized
form, nor augmented with extra elements not occurring in our
sources.
term appear in Tibetan in one rite and in Sanskrit in another, ac-
cording to origin-supposing it were even possible to apply such a
rule consistently-would be not only confusing but seriously mis-
leading, greatly exaggerating what differences there are. Also,
Sanskrit is more convenient as its spelling is phonetic, whereas
with Tibetan it is often necessary to provide both a transliteration
and a phonetic transcription. To be sure of the equivalences of the
descriptive terms between Sanskrit and Tibetan, the bilingual text
Nispanna-yogâvalī was translated first.
For one term of debated meaning, like many Buddhist transla-
tors through the centuries I have coined a new word. I offer 'poly-
lotus' as an etymologically exact but more euphonious equivalent
to visvapadma (sna-tshogs padma).
Sanskrit names and terms are written in the standard transliter-
ation, which like the original spelling is strictly phonetic, though
not all the letters have the same sounds as in English. It should be
noted that c is pronounced like English 'ch' and ch is similar but
aspirated (i.e., breathier);th and ph are aspirated versions of t and
p, not at all like the sounds in 'nothing' or 'phone'.
Tibetan spelling being far more difficult for the novice, with its
many silent letters, Tibetan names in the text or within sadhana
names, and the few Tibetan words retained, have usually been
spelled in a rough phonetic manner. However, in headings, notes,
indexes and elsewhere, exact transliterations are given. These are
always italicized, whereas phonetic transcriptions are in roman,
except for names of texts. The Tibetan transliterations follow the
system used in Lokesh Chandra's extensive publications on the
Rinjung, designed for maximum compatibility with the Sanskrit
transliteration. Part of this system is the use of y(borrowed from
the Mongolian transcription system) for the silent prefix g-before
y.
This book has been conceived visually from an early stage,
and would probably have been impossible to complete had I not
typeset it myself. To begin with, I created a font and coding
system that included the special characters I needed and typed the
work in a simple word processor. The printout of the manuscript,
however, turned out to be impractical to work with. The book
is so intrinsically complex, with its multiple levels of headings,
many of them multilingual, and its many kinds of matter from
a multiplicity of sources interspersed, that typographic devices
were essential to make the structure visible and comprehensible.
Conventions followed
A number of terms have been retained in Sanskrit in the transla-
tions, perhaps rather more than some readers would like. This is
unavoidable as many have no concise English equivalent, or their
meaning is ambiguous or disputed.
Some find the use of Sanskrit incongruous in translations from
Tibetan. There are texts for which Tibetan is preferable, but in
rites like those here, which even when not translated from San-
skrit still derive from the Indian models, there is every advantage
in following the general preference for Sanskrit. To have the same



Translator's Introduction
227
Fortunately I discovered Donald Knuth's estimable typesetting
system, TEX, which supported all the needed characters. All the
rest of the editing and revision was done in TeX.
In the body of the text, italics are used for text titles in any lan-
guage, and foreign words in exact transcription, other than names;
SMALL CAPS for seed syllables and mantras, apart from non-Indic
phrases; and slanted type for text not directly translated from
the source, such as passages of précis and the translator's com-
ments. In addition, several kinds of brackets are used to distin-
guish sources and so forth, as detailed in the list of abbreviations
and the introduction to each part.
The skipping of a passage of source text is signaled by a small
vertical space of about a quarter of a line.
Capitalization is used to mark proper names, Buddhist objects
of worship (any part of the Three Jewels), and words used with
a special meaning that transcends their everyday usage. In the
last two uses, it serves to represent to some extent the effect of
the honorific words that in Tibetan are frequently employed to
indicate respect and often a non-everyday meaning.
What is to be considered a proper name is often a matter of
subjective judgement, reflecting the writer's world-view. Here it
has to be decided from the point of view of the source texts. A
Tibetan Buddhist will count as proper names the names of many
'persons' and 'places' that a secular Western outlook might dismiss
as merely metaphorical abstractions. To a practitioner, deities,
"places' on the Buddhist Path, and particular mandala palaces and
places within them are in a sense more real than ordinary people
and mundane, physical places, and so even more deserving of
capitalization.
This would hardly be worth mentioning but for the fact that
there is at present a powerful campaign to prohibit all personal
discretion in the use of capitals (and other punctuation) in English,
eliminating an aid to expression and communication that has been
in use for centuries. One can understand newspaper publishers,
beset by extreme pressures of time, wishing to be able to check
copy mechanically without the intervention of human thought-
although as a reader one is reluctant to forgive the waste of one's
own time as one struggles to resolve the resulting ambiguities. But
with books there is no such excuse and all who care about preci-
sion and freedom of communication should resist such arbitrary
restrictions.
Remarks on deity names
Typically a manifestation of a deity has both a basic name and a
phrase that qualifies it to specify the particular form. When, as
in most cases, the deity originated in India, we have adopted a
standard Sanskrit form for the basic name. The specific names,
however, have generally been translated into English when practi-
cable. When the translation is doubtful or the Sanskrit particularly
memorable, the Sanskrit form is sometimes preferred.
Names of Indian people have when possible been given in
Sanskrit likewise, and names of Tibetans in phonetic Tibetan.
However, thorough Sanskrit and Tibetan indexes are provided.
The former includes Sanskrit forms for many components of
names not given in Sanskrit in the text, while the latter includes
all the name components, even of Indian persons, as they appear
in the Tibetan sources.
Both the basic and specific names of a deity are often variable.
Many deities have alternative basic names, e.g., Manjughosa/
Mañjuśrī, Vajrapāņi/Guhyakadhipati. In some cases the alter-
native name is similar but differs in meaning, and it can also
be that one form is preferred in talking about the deity and an-
other in mantras, e.g. Vaisravana ('Son of Visravas), mantra name
Vaiśramana ('Resting'); Sarasvati ('Abounding in water', a river
name), mantra name Svarasvati ('Abounding in musical notes or
vowels'). As neither form is uniquely correct, the two forms echo
each other in wordplay that adds richness and depth to the name.5
The Sarasvati/Svarasvati variation is not reflected in the Ti-
betan. Sarasvati is regularly translated into Tibetan as dbyans-can-
ma, which is the literal equivalent of Svarasvati. So when we find
dbYans-can-ma in a Tibetan text it is correct to write Sarasvati in our
English translation rather than Svarasvati-one of many instances
where translating Tibetan syllable by syllable is wrong.
The same applies to the deity name most often written in San-
skrit as Sambara. Not itself a meaningful Sanskrit word, though
it has echoes of several, this is usually translated into Tibetan
as bDe-mchog, after a fanciful etymology as sam+vara ('best hap-
piness'). Sometimes the same name is etymologized differently
as samvara ('restraint') and translated as sDom-pa. Several other
spellings, some meaningful and some not, occur in Sanskrit text
and mantras and are not reflected in Tibetan. The most appropri-
ate course in English is to use the one form Sambara consistently
and let it carry the weight of all the meaningful variations.



228
Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
various yaksas, who though bound under oath to help the Doctrine
are not objects of Refuge. Yidams can be graded according to
the classes of Tantra (see Glossary: Tantra). In between Yidams
and supermundane Protectors come other Buddhas, Bodhisattvas,
Pratyeka-buddhas, Śrāvaka Arhants such as the Sixteen Elders, and
Dākas and Dākinis.
More generally, just as a high-ranking human typically has a
large number of names and titles, so the limitless power of a deity
is expressed in innumerable names. The most popular deities
are frequently honored with lists of 108 different names. These
names, however, are more in the nature of epithets and cannot
usually stand on their own to identify the deity.
The specific name may identify the deity form in terms of its
attributes, its origin, the tradition through which the practice has
been transmitted, its function, its mantra, the group or mandala of
deities in which it is practiced, and so forth. It often has several
such components, the selection of which may be quite arbitrary
provided enough information is given to enable identification in
the context.
However, just because a name element is descriptive, it does not
follow it is not really part of the name. For instance, the 'White'
in White Tārā is indubitably part of the name, as is evident from
the fact that there exist white Tārās (such as 297 and 299) that
are not White Tārās. It is therefore useful and even necessary
to discriminate whether a word is being used as a name or as a
description, and to capitalize it in the former case. Sometimes the
decision may be less clear-cut, and must depend on the translator's
judgement (it is certainly no place for the arbitrary imposition of
publishers' rules).
Some deity names are of intermediate extension, e.g., Knife
Mahākāla is a subset of Mahākāla including several forms.
While the title of a sādhana, as in the headings of our texts,
can usually be used as the name of its principal deity, this is not
always the case. Since the sādhana name refers to the whole set of
principal deity plus attendants, it may not be sensible to apply it to
the principal alone. For example, it is absurd to speak (as Nebesky-
Wojkowitz does) of 'a form' of Mahäkāla called Traksad and Knife
Mahäkälas Practiced Together, though this makes good sense as
the title of a practice (380) involving the two forms, Trakşad Mahā-
kāla and Knife Mahākāla.
Presentation of the mantras
The Yidams are mostly of undoubted Indian origin. When a
new form originates by revelation to a Tibetan practitioner, it
is a variation on an established Indian basic deity and it is still
appropriate to use the latter's Sanskrit name when referring to
it. Its mantra will be either identical to or a development of an
existing mantra of that deity. Thus the Yidams typically have
mantras that, if not in classical Sanskrit, at least suggest some
meaning to a Sanskritist, and it is possible and helpful to regularize
their spelling (inaccurate and variable in most Tibetan texts) to
some degree. This has been done conservatively, preserving some
systematic deviations from classical Sanskrit.
The Protectors owe more to sources outside India. Their
mantras vary a lot between forms of the same deity and often
contain non-sanskrit words. The non-indic elements will be
distinguished by being printed in lower case. Where they are
not Tibetan, their division into words is entirely speculative.
The mantras are written in such a way as to enable both Indian
and Tibetan pronunciations to be deduced. Those who prefer
standard Sanskrit should simply ignore the distinction between V
and w: both represent Sanskrit v. Those who prefer to pronounce
mantras in Tibetan style, however, should read both B and V as b
and w as w, besides making the usual changes of cts, CH tsh
and )--dz (and adding nasals and vowel modification according
to taste). That the same word in the same mantra is spelled
differently in different sādhanas doubtless reflects different lamas'
differing pronunciations.
For the convenience of readers not expert in Sanskrit, Sanskrit
compounds have often been broken into their constituent words,
using hyphens and (where vowels have merged) circumflexes.
For example, the compound TRAI-LOKYAKȘEPA is made up of
TRAI + LOKYA + AKSEPA; the -A of LOKYA and the A- of AKȘEPA,
though theoretically merged into a single -ā- sound, are still felt
to be sufficiently separate that they are often written separately in
The classification of deities
The most important division among the deities in this collection is
that between Yidams, the tutelary deities on which one's practice
may be centred, and the Protectors of the Doctrine, who assist
practitioners. The latter include both supermundane Protectors,
such as Mahākāla and Sri-devi, and worldly protectors, such as

Tibetan transcription.
Also to assist such readers, tentative 'translatory meanings' (cf.
Staal 1989) have been provided for many of the more intelligible
mantras. A mantra as such cannot be translated; but still the
superficial meaning of words within it can often provide a useful
clue as to the subject matter and the purpose of the rite. The
interjections and seed syllables, of symbolic significance, are
necessarily left untranslated. The words are often ambiguous:
some are deliberately misspelled to give a resonance of another,
similar-sounding word, some have a wide variety of meanings; the
inflections are often unconventional and do not reliably indicate
the syntax, and in any case are often absent as many words are
simply joined in compounds with no indication of the logical
connection between them. Since mantras consist mainly of strings
of epithets, imperatives and expletives, the context often does little
to resolve the ambiguities, and besides, only rarely are traditional
teachings on the meaning of a mantra available as a guide. Add to
these difficulties the numerous misprints in the source texts and
one may start to realize how mantras can be so hard to interpret
that some scholars have dismissed them entirely as meaningless
gibberish.
The label 'X' (= Xylograph) refers to the versions of the mantras
on the reverse of the blockprints of the Icons Worthwhile to See, in
the Tachikawa et al. edition unless otherwise stated. These will be
found collected above (pp. 211-22). "Tār.' denotes readings from
Tāranātha's Rinjung Gyatsa.
and as an album of drawings in a markedly different style at the
Asiatic Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in St Peters-
burg, published by Oldenburg (1903) (O). Oldenburg states that
these drawings, in Indian ink on European paper and 12 x 12.5 cm
in size, are the work of a Buryat or Chinese artist, and from the
binding the album appears to have come from the collection of
Baron Schilling von Kanstadt. O has been widely reproduced, in
Lokesh Chandra (1959-61), Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra (1961-
72), Olschak & Wangyal (1972), and as a set of posters by Lokesh
Chandra. B has been reproduced, together with the mantras on
the reverse sides, by Lokesh Chandra (1986), and all three ver-
sions are reprinted in Lohia (1994) opposite an English translation
of Pander's (1890) German text.
The other collection cross-referenced is the set of 139 complete
mandalas from the Ngor monastery, which have been published as
line drawings in Raghu Vira & Lokesh Chandra (1961-72), Parts
13-15; in full color with a key to the deities in two enormous
volumes by bSod-nams rgya-mtsho et al. (1983); and in compact
black and white form by bSod-nams rgya-mtsho & Tachikawa
(1989, 1991). In this case, cross-referencing is usually confined to
cases where our present sources mention attendants and not just
the principal deity.
The results of the comparison with these two collections also
appear in tabular form in the Concordances, Tables 6-7.
In addition, a number of references are made to the Sanskrit
edition of the Sadhana-mala (Sm). For lack of convenient access to
this work, comparison has generally been limited to the mantras.
The important task of comparing the iconography of the present
collection systematically with Sm and its Tibetan translation (the
Sādhana-samuccaya), as well as with the other sādhana collections
in the Tängyur, remains for the future.
Comparisons and cross-references
At the end of each sadhana, any discrepancies noticed between the
textual description of the deities and their pictorial representation
in the miniature paintings presented above will be listed under
the rubric 'Deviations'. In addition, cross-references will be given
to similar (but not necessarily iconographically identical) repre-
sentations or descriptions elsewhere in the present work and in
two other well-known iconographic collections.
The first of these is the Three Hundred Images (3001), so
styled (sKu-brñan brgya-phrag-gsum or sku-brñan sum-brgya) in its
preface, by the Changkya Qutuytu Röl-pei Dorje (Can-skya Rol-
pa'i rdo-rje, 1717-1786), chief lama at the Manchu court of Ch'ien-
lung (1736-95). It is known as a Peking blockprint (B), as sketches
after this and other blockprints published by Pander (1890) (P),
Reference materials
Indexes in English, Sanskrit, Tibetan and Mongolian are provided
in Section III below. The latter three cover names, principally
those that occur in the plate captions in Section I or in the texts
translated in the present volume. The first index, however, in Eng-
lish alphabetical order, also includes a great many other entries:
glossary entries explaining the Sanskrit words and other technical
terms used; iconographic features, including exhaustive coverage
of the hand-emblems and gestures of the deities illustrated; and



230
Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
a number of analytical articles, notably those on colors, mantra,
ornaments, postures and Tantra.
References to the plates and source texts are in terms of the icon
numbers. Where there are several figures in one icon, they are
distinguished by letters, to which diagrammatic keys are provided
in Section I. These identification letters apart, the indexes can also
be used with a blockprint edition of IWS, with the aid of Tables
1-3 of the Concordances.
Identification
It was clear from the outset that this extensive collection was
a valuable resource for those who wish to identify the deity
represented in a painting or statue. Special reference materials
were therefore prepared in order to assist this.
The first step is to try and recognize each hand-emblem and
gesture. Robert Beer's Pictorial Index is intended to help here.
Thereafter, there are two main routes. The first is via individual
iconographic features, using the index of every feature likely to
be helpful in identification, incorporated in the General Index.
The second is via the overall form, using the Identification Guide,
which lists all the deities in the book in a systematic morphological
order. Which route is more effective will vary from case to case,
but a combination of the two should reveal quite quickly whether
or not your deity is iconographically equivalent to one in IWS.

3. At this point progress was in fact interrupted for many months while
I developed software to assist with compiling the indexes, to avoid
extensive retyping and the increased risk of errors this would entail.
This eventually resulted in applications that sorted the word processor
files in English, Sanskrit or Tibetan alphabetical order. Tibetan sorting
involves not only recoding the headword text into sort units (which do
not always correspond one-to-one with the letters of Tibetan script),
but rearranging these units according to rules some of which are
arcane and not applied consistently in existing dictionaries.

5. To take an analogy from physics, if we ask what the true name is,
we may say it is the superposition of the two, like a particle in a
superposition of two quantum states; but a measurement will find
the particle in one state or the other, and likewise when the name is
written down it will be in one or the other form.

grans tshan-bn ('Images of the field of merit of the Gurus, Yidams, Three
Supreme Ones (= Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) and their attendants,
to the full count of three hundred').
8. Though Oldenburg's account is plausible enough, the nature of his
originals has been widely misrepresented. To take a recent example,
Mevissen (1998: 315), despite quoting other information from Old-
enburg's introduction, ignores him on this fundamental point and
claims that the St Petersburg album was 'an original xylograph' and
that the images were redrawn from it at the Asiatic Museum, possibly
even by Albert Grünwedel as Lohia (1994: 1) has suggested. Given
the style of the drawings and the fact that they do not try to imitate
the appearance and proportions of the xylograph images as a Western
copyist would, this story lacks credibility.

Lokesh Chandra (1963: 6 and n. 8) to redefine the extent and divisions
of this collection is based on a misinterpretation of Cordier's catalogue
and entirely untenable.

up in fake Sanskrit and pretend it comes from within the Indo-Tibetan
Buddhist tradition.



Part One
The Rinjung Gyatsa
The major part of the Icons Worthwhile to See illustrates a large
collection of deity practices compiled by Tāranātha (1575-1634),
commonly known as the Rinjung Gyatsa (Rin-'byun brgya-rtsa) or
Jewel-mine hundred-odd' (although it contains far more than a
hundred practices) after his title The Mine of Jewels, sadhanas of
the ocean of Yidam deities. The Fourth Panchen Rinpoche, Tenpei
Nyima? (1781-1854), amplified Tāranātha's work in The Clear
Meaning of the Jewel Mine, an expansion of 'The Mine of Jewels,
sādhanas of the ocean of Yidam deities', which presents for each
deity not only the practice to be performed regularly (sādhana,
sgrub-thabs) but the rite for conferring permission to practice (rjes-
gnan). This massive text, in two volumes of iv+521 and v+476
folios respectively, has been reprinted by Lokesh Chandra under
the title Sadhana-mālā of the Panchen Lama, and constitutes our
source. It is convenient to refer to it by the abbreviated title that
appears in the margin of each page, Rin-lhan. In references we
shall further abbreviate it to R. Its two volumes are equipped with
an unusually detailed table of contents, or dkar-chag, to which we
shall refer as Rk.
peaceful Buddhas such as Sakyamuni and the Medicine Guru, and
their attendants. Then, in chapter 17, appear many practices for
the obtaining of wealth; some of the deities used for this purpose
are worldly figures who should not be practiced as Yidams.
Finally, from chapter 18 on, there are the wrathful Protectors
of the Doctrine, notably Mahākāla in over fifty forms and the
Glorious Goddess (dPal-ldan lha-mo, Śrī-devi). We may note that
the closing deities in chapter 23 are also classed as Protectors,
though peaceful.
Within each chapter, there are normally no explicit subdivisions
intermediate between the levels of the chapter and the individual
sādhana. Nevertheless, the sādhanas are often arranged in logical
groups, so headings will be supplied (in brackets) to make such
groupings plain.
Structure of a sādhana
The sadhanas of the Rin-lhan are generally too long to give in full,
and it would besides be hardly appropriate to do so in a book
intended for public sale.
In general, a practice is preceded by physical preparations such
as drawing mandalas and setting out suitable offerings. These may
be very elaborate and the instructions are often highly technical
and unintelligible to those who have not been trained in the
tradition. So this section will be omitted unless it is necessary
for understanding other parts of the rite.
The actual practice -- see 4 for an example given in full-
always includes the preliminaries of going for Refuge, generating
Structure of the Rin-than
The Rin-than is divided into 23 chapters, as shown in our table
of contents. In the opening and closing chapters are practices
of deities it is thought particularly auspicious to put in those
positions. In between, chapters 2 to 16 present the Yidams (Tib. yi-
dam, Skt ista-devatā), the tutelary deities with which practitioners
seek to identify themselves. They begin in chapter 2 with the
231



232
Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
Bodhicitta and meditating on the Four Immeasurables, followed
by dissolving everything into Emptiness, typically with the OM
SVABHĀVA mantra. The deity visualization may then be generated
first in front of the practitioner, as a field of merit for performance
of the Seven-Limbs, then dissolved again. More often, the self-
generation follows the first dissolution into Emptiness.
The self-generation, in which the practitioner builds up the
visualized image of himself or herself as the deity, will usually
be given in full, beginning 'Out of Emptiness ...', except for in-
terpolated mantras and word-for-word repetitions of descriptions
already given. Descriptions of attendants not depicted in the illus-
trations, however, will sometimes be shortened. The largest-scale
features of the visualized mandala universe are also not illustrated
and may be omitted or abbreviated.
A few practices do not involve self-generation as the deity, but
only its generation in front of the practitioner. This is carried out
after self-generation as some other deity, either a particular one
or the practitioner's own tutelary deity (yi-dam). In such cases,
the front generation therefore contains the description of the deity
and will be translated below.
On completion of the self-generation, one visualizes a white
OM syllable at the crown, a red AĦ at the throat and a blue HŪM
at the heart. Sometimes SwĀ and HĀ at the two lower cakras are
added. Light-rays from the HŪM strike the already-existing deity
in its habitual abode and draw its essence back to the heart of
the visualized deity (or Pledge-being). There it generally resides
as a Gnosis-being, typically a tiny replica of the Pledge-being but
sometimes (as in 4-7) quite different. At the heart of the Gnosis-
being may be a Concentration-being, normally the seed-syllable
of the deity on a sun- or moon-disk. The standard Om Āụ HÜM
will not be mentioned. From the invocation, the deity's place of
abode will be quoted if it is given and is not simply 'the abode of
True Nature' (ran-bzin-gyi gnas, i.e., Emptiness). The visualization
at the heart is of some significance and will be quoted.
Next there usually follows the self-empowerment, which is
highly standardized and will be familiar to all practitioners. Em-
powering deities of the Five Families are invoked, greeted with
offerings, and visualized giving empowerment by pouring nectar
on the crown of the head. The nectar fills the body, eliminating
impurities, and overflows, the residue condensing into the form of
the Master of the Family on the crown. The name of this crowning
deity will be given.
The remaining sections of the sādhana typically include verses
of praise and homage, which often help in understanding the
character of a deity and will therefore be translated; standard
offerings; recitation of the principal deity's heart-mantra and
perhaps other mantras; presentation of the torma (gtor-ma), the
ritual offering-cake of dough; and requests.
The recited mantras are important to the definition of a deity's
individuality to the extent that many deities are named after their
mantras, and they therefore have to be quoted. A visualization
always accompanies the mantra recitation; the standard one is to
visualize the syllables of the mantra standing round the edge of a
sun or moon disk at the deity's heart, with the seed-syllable in the
center, with light-rays spreading, performing the action of the rite
and returning in a manner so familiar the text usually dispenses
with description. This visualization is the very heart of the sādhana
and sometimes includes the very feature the deity is named after,
so it will be quoted if it differs from the standard.
The torma offering is often very long-winded and thoroughly
standardized, so will be ignored apart from the odd instructive
verse of praise. Requests will occasionally be quoted if they throw
light on the deity's character.
Conferral rites
In addition to the sădhana of each deity, the Rin-lhan generally
gives in full the rite by which the lama confers on disciples the.
right to practice it. This is usually longer than the sādhana itself,
and repeats much of it verbatim, especially the self-generation and
mantras (providing a useful check on readings). Here we indicate
the type of this rite (if stated), most often a permission (rjes-gnan),
and the structure of its core section if any internal headings were
found. We ignore the preparations made by the lama himself, the
preliminaries performed once the disciples (washed and in clean
clothing) have entered, the opening stages of the actual permission
(notably the self-generation), and the concluding practices. The
preliminaries include, in addition to those found in the sādhanas,
a request for permission, inspiration or whatever and sometimes
the taking of vows and pledges. The request does not always agree
with the stated type of the rite—if there is a distinction between a
permission and an inspiration rite, it is not rigidly adhered to.

Tāranātha's text
Although the translation was made using the Rin-than alone, it
later became possible to compare it with the original source by
Tāranātha. The comparison makes clear what the Panchen Lama
was seeking to do, namely, to create a performing edition. Both
texts present the same sādhanas, in the same order—though one or
two variants mentioned only briefly by Tāranātha are expanded
into full sādhanas in the Rin-than. But Taranātha frequently gives
brief instructions such as 'Give offerings and praise,' or describes
a deity in terms of differences from a form given earlier. The Pan-
chen Rinpoche will supply the necessary offering mantras and
other recitations, and a suitable praise (often from an external
source), and combine the differences with the earlier deity de-
scription to create the wording needed for a self-contained, per-
formable rite.
This amplification more than doubles the length of the text. But
on the other hand, Tāranātha's text contains a lot of material not
essential to the performance of the rites, including prefatory and
concluding verses to each rite, comments on variants, analysis
and, last but not least, an appendix listing the lineages by which
all the practices came to him. The bulk of this is omitted from the
Rin-than
Tāranātha divides his text into three unequal volumes, the
middle one comprising the wrathful protectors' rites. This is not
only logical but must have facilitated keeping these potentially
dangerous practices from unsuitable eyes. The Rin-lhan, by
contrast, is chopped roughly in halves in the middle of a chapter.
A good deal of material from Tāranātha has been included
below, either labeled 'Tār.' or placed within angle brackets (...).
This includes many different names that Tāranātha used for the
sādhanas, either at the end of the rite or when referring to it
elsewhere. While time did not permit a systematic analysis of
the lineages, some information from them has been added and his
lists of rites associated with certain key figures have been inserted
in the index.
Although it is clear from details of the captions and content
that the Icons Worthwhile to See follows the Rin-than, there is some
evidence that the artists also had access to Täranātha's text: the
colors and emblems of 301 c-e, not described in the Rin-Ihan,
accord with Tāranātha.

PRELIMINARIES
The Clear Meaning of the Jewel Mine,
an expansion of The Mine of Jewels,
sādhanas of the ocean of Yidam deities
Homage to the ocean-like hosts of Gurus, Yidams and Dharma-protectors!
Throughout the rosary of my births, I pay homage with the crown of my head to the lotus feet
of the jewel of the sky, the King of Sages,' accomplisher of the two benefits,?
Gloriously radiant with the perfectly clear Marks and Signs produced from an ocean of pa-
tience uniting Method and Wisdom,
Who with the nature of the precious Three Bodies quickly grants prayers, and by emitting a
thousand light-rays of sevenfold clear explanation
Illuminates the good Path to high rebirth and Liberation, cutting off wandering due to the host
of actions of wrong-sayers and spirits.
Though you totally abandoned anger,
still you overthrew wrong view;
Free of accepting or casting off worldly bonds,
you flung all coarse action far away.
Free of desire for bliss in samsāra or Peace,
through love for beings, with speech you developed
Though it transcends both words and objects of speech,
the profound meaning, and vanquished the learned.
The lake combining the nine excellent rivers of teaching
Flowing from that snow mountain, the great-minded Sage,
Vibrates with the trains of waves of your fame, O Tsongk'a-pa,
The triple world's creatures' Guru, my object of homage!
Adorned with golden nets of the threefold Training,
With six tusks of teaching, debate and composition,
Elephants beating all foes of the two obscurations,
To you, host of direct and lineage Gurus, I bow.

Author's Preface
The teacher of Tantra, Mahā-vajradhara, taught in the precious
divisions of the Tantras an infinitude of deity sadhanas, corre-
sponding to the various dispositions of disciples. The Mahātma
Acārya Abhyākara-Igupta) and others collected in one place
[the sadhanas) that were scattered in India, as the sGrub-thabs
brgya-rgya-ma (= *Sūdhana-sataka-sāgara?) etc. To the sadhanas
and permissions in the main body were appended certain well-
known and useful ones and some very rare lineages.Venerable
Tāranatha studied with two Indian teachers and many Tibetan
scholar-practitioners and collected [these] together (with] the
differing traditions of assertions in the thought of the Tantras
and among various teachers as to the rites for taking care of dis-
ciples, including bestowal of inspiring power (byin-rlabs), per-
mission (rjes-gnan), knowledge-transfer (rig-gtad), recitation-
transmission (bzlas-lun), and in some cases accomplishment
through transmission (un) alone, creating this Mine of Jewel
Sādhanas (sGrub-thabs rin-chen "hyun-gnas). Thus not only does
this consist solely of excellent explanations from the complete
and perfect Buddha, transmitted from one holy being to an-
other without any diminution of the marks of inspiration, but
it is reliable, without any inconsistency with the teachings of Je
[Tsongk'a-pa) and his (two] chief disciples or the intention of
the Tantras.
Although there are many learned practitioners in our school
who hold in their minds the Conqueror's Doctrine, maintaining
and spreading widely the permissions explained here, particu-
larly with the appended permissions it is necessary to search out
the lineage of each one; in this age when practicing the Dharma
is thought unimportant, there are lineages that are very rare and
on the way to disappearing soon. It is necessary to avert this
danger; and when the rivers of many pure doctrines flow abun-
dantly, it is certain the great ocean of the teaching of the second
Conqueror, Je [Tsongk'a-pa), will increase more and more....
Hence the present work.

edition: Gyud-grel, Vols THU, DU), starting with the one for which
Abhayakara-gupta was responsible, the Pa-tshab sgrub-thabs brgya-

the Ba-ri sgrub-thabs brgya-rtsa (P4127-4220/Toh. 3305-3399) and

1-3. Je Tsongk'a-pa and his two chief disciples
(rle yab-sras-gsum)
Je Rinpoche, Precious Lord', is a title of the great teacher Lama -
Tsongk'a-pa (Tson-kha-pa), or Lozang Trapa (bLo-bzan grags-pa),
who lived from 1357 to 1419 and is revered as the founder of
the Gelukpa school. Just as the Panchen Rinpoche has paid
his respects to him in the homage verses and preface above, so
the Gelukpa producers of this collection of illustrations preface
their work with this image of him.
He is shown as he is visualized in Guru-yoga practices, in the
triad known as 'the Father and his two Sons' (Yab-sras-gsum).
We may note that the Panchen Lamas are held to be incarnations
of the youngest member of the triad, K'edrup Je.
As there is no description in the text, we give one from oral
teachings on the Tsongk'a-pa Guru-yoga,
(2) On a jewel throne supported by lions, on a lotus, sun and
moon seat sits the essence of your own Guru and of all the
Gurus of the ten directions in the form of Lama Tsongk'a-pa.
His skin is white but shines a beautiful pink in places such as the
lips and cheeks. His two hands are in the gesture of explaining
the Dharma--the right hand facing outwards reflecting the
teaching of others, and the left facing inwards the inner practice
and realization of the teachings within oneself. Both hands
hold the stems of lotuses, the flowers opening at the level of
his ears, on the right-hand flower is a wisdom sword and on
the left a book of the Perfection of Wisdom, radiating light and
sound of this scripture and the compassion and wisdom that
arise from it. He wears the three robes of a monk, symbols of
pure morality, and a pointed yellow hat, yellow for the clarity
of his understanding and teachings and pointed for his sharp
wisdom. His legs are crossed in vajra-paryanka, symbolizing his
attainment of the two Bodies of a fully enlightened Buddha.
At his heart is orange Manjughoșa, at his heart Vajradhara,
patron of Tantra, and at his heart a dark blue HUM syllable. -
(1) On a lower throne on Tsongk'a-pa's right is his disciple
Gyelts'ap D'arma Rinchen (rGyal-shab Dar-ma rin-chen, 1364-
1432), called Gyal-tshab (Regent) because he was lineage-holder
after Tsongk'a-pa's passing. He is very calm and peaceful.
(3) On Tsongk'a-pa's left is K'edrup Je (1385–1438), somewhat
younger than Gyelts'ap and slightly wrathful, with large eyes
giving an impression of great power. Both these disciples have
their right hands in the gesture of explaining the Dharma, their
left in that of meditation and holding a book. They too wear
monks' robes and yellow hats and sit cross-legged. They have
the Marks and Signs of a Buddha and radiate light.
At their hearts are the deities they are emanations of, four-
armed Avalokita and wrathful Vajrapāni respectively. At either
deity's heart is Vajradhara and at his heart a blue HŪM.

1. SOME SADHANAS DESIRABLE AT THE BEGINNING FOR AUSPICIOUSNESS
[4-7. Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā (sGrol-dkar
yid-bżin 'khor-lo)]
4. Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Täră in the tradition of
Atīsa (Jo-lugs-kyi sGrol-dkar yid-bzin 'khor-lo)
This sädhana is given in full by way of example. In subsequent
sādhanas, the preliminaries and other standardized portions of
the rite will be omitted.
Taking Refuge and generating Bodhicitta
Take Refuge, saying three times:
I and all sentient beings of the destinies as far as the
limits of space, from now until we reach the
supreme point of Enlightenment go for Refuge
to the glorious, holy Gurus.
We go for Refuge to the deity hosts of the mandalas of
the Yidams.
We go for Refuge to the Perfect Buddha Bhagavans.
We go for Refuge to the holy Dharmas.
We go for Refuge to the Arya Sanghas.
Generate Bodhicitta, saying three times:
To the Buddhas, the Dharma and the Supreme Assem-
bly
[1 go for Refuge till I am enlightened.
By this practice of Giving and other Perfections,
May I reach Buddhahood, so as to benefit beings.]
Perform the special generation of Bodhicitia, by saying three
times:
For the sake of all sentient beings, I must quickly win
Omniscience, the state of Buddhahood. Therefore I
shall undertake the visualization and recitation of Arya
Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā.
[Front generation)
At my heart on a moon is a white TĀM, whose light-rays invite
Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā, surrounded by a host of root
and lineage Gurus, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, to the space in
front (of me). OM VAJRA-SAMAJAH, PADMA-KAMALAYE STAM.
NAMO GURUBHYAH, NAMO ĀRYA-TĀRE SA-PARIWĀRA-MANDA-
LABHYAH. (Om vajra assembly, lotus-flower, stam. Homage to
the Gurus, homage to Arya-tārā and her mandala of attendants!)
[Homage and Offering!
By your kindness, Great Bliss itself
[Arises in a mere instant.
Jewel-like Guru Vajradhara,
To your lotus feet I bow.
Mother of the three times' Buddhas,
Giver of wealth of immortal life,
Tārā, granter of all desires,
With your deity host: I bow to you.
Offer greeting-water with OM ĀRYA-TÄRE SA-PARIWARA
ARGHAM PRATICCHA SWĀHĀ. (Om Arya-tārā and your atten-
dants, accept greeting-water, swāha!) Putting PĀDYAM in place
of ARGHIAM, offer foot-washing water.
With OM ĀRYA-TĀRE SA-PARIWĀRA VAJRA-PUSPE AĦ HŪM and
similarly with [PUŞPE replaced by] DHŪPE, ĀLOKE, GANDHE,
NAIWEDYE and SABDA," offer mentally the standard offerings:
[flowers, incense, light, perfume, food and music).
Recite three times (the Seven Limb prayer):
To the Three Jewels I go for Refuge.
[All evil actions I confess.
I rejoice in migrators' merits.
I keep in mind Enlightenment
To Buddha, Dharma, and Supreme Assembly
I go for Refuge till I'm enlightened.
To realize my own and others' benefits
I shall generate Bodhicitta.
Having produced the thought of supreme Bodhi,
I shall look after all sentient beings as guests,
And practice the pleasing, supreme, Bodhi conduct.
For the sake of migrators, may I realize Buddhahood!
Request (the deities) to come with: OM VAJRA MUH!
[The Four Immeasurables]
Say:
May all sentient beings have happiness and its cause!
May they be free of suffering and its cause!
May they be inseparable from sorrowless bliss!
May they all abide in measureless equanimity, free of
bias, greed or hatred!

[Dissolution of front generation]
Contemplating that all dharmas are but one's own mind, and
the essence of Mind is the union of clarity and Emptiness, like
the moon in water, say: OM ŠUNYATĀ-JÑĀNA-VAJRA-SVABIĀV-
ATMAKO 'HAM. (Om I am of the nature of the vajra essence of
Gnosis of Emptiness.)
[Self-generation]
Out of Emptiness, increate mind appears as HŪM, whose sound
fills space. From the HŪM come a vnjra ground, and a wall,
canopy and blazing mass of fire, forming a guardian circle. In
the middle, from BHRUM comes the physical world as a palace
of moon-crystal. In the center, from PAM comes a thousand-
petaled white lotus with fully-developed stem, branches and
leaves, and on its center, from A, an immaculate full moon.
Thereon the essence of my mind appears as a white syllable
TĀM, which turns into the stem of a white utpala whose stamens
are marked with a white TĀM. From this light-rays spread, make
offering to the Āryas and benefit all sentient beings, come back
and dissolve into it, transforming it into myself, the goddess
Tarā of the Wish-fulfilling Wheel (Cintāmani-cakra), white as the
moon, shining and immaculate like the moonstone and radiant
with five-colored light-rays. She has an extremely peaceful
smile and seven large eyes like utpala petals (i.e. three on the
face, one on each palm and sole). Her right hand is boon-
granting and herleft thumb and ring finger hold at her heart the
root of the stem of a white utpala, which opens, fully developed,
beside her ear. She has a graceful, affectionate manner and
a beautiful pair of breasts, and is embellished with a crown,
earrings, choker, necklace with pendant, long necklace, armlets,
bracelets, girdle and anklets with strings of little bells on, of all
kinds of jewels, especially white pearls, as well as numerous
heavenly flowers. She wears a white silk scarf and lower-body
wrappings of assorted silks. The braids of her curly hair, tied
at the back of her neck, are waving. With a youthful body, she
sits proudly in vajra-paryanka, with a moon as back-rest.
On a moon at her brow is a white OM, on a lotus at her throat
a red AĦ, and on a sun at her heart a blue HÜM. In the dot of
the HŪM, on a white lotus and moon, is a white TĀM.
[Invocation of Gnosis-being]
From my heart, light-rays spread. From the abode of True
Nature, whole deity host of Venerable Arya White Tārā: VAJRA-
SAMĀJAH!
Make offerings with: OM VAJRA-ARGHAM SWĀHĀ. OM VAJRA-
PĀDYAM SWĀHA. OM VAJRA-PUSPE AĦ HUM, etc., up to: OM
VAJRA-SABDA ĀH HUM.
JAH HŪM VAM HOLI, they dissolve into non-duality, Pledge-
being and Gnosis-being becoming inseparable in essence.
[Self-empowerment]
Once more, from the HŪM at my heart light-rays spread. Em-
powering deities, Conquerors of the Five Families and your
attendants: VAJRA-SAMĀJAH!
Make offering as before, with OM PANCA-KULA-SA-PARIWĀRA
ARGHAM... SABDA
All you Tathagatas, please grant me empowerment! Upon
this request, the empowering deities, saying:
Just as, at the Holy Birth,
Gods made offering of baths,
1, with purest, heavenly water
Offer you this bath likewise.
OM SARVA-TATHĀGATA-ABHISIKATA-SAMAYA-ŚRI HUM!
(Om glory of the pledge consecrated by all the
Tathāgatas hum!)
empower me with the flask water. It fills my whole body,
and purifies all stains of the two obscurations. Excess water
overflows and becomes Ratnasambhava, who adorns my head.
[Make offering with) OM ĀRYA-TĀRE SA-PARIWĀRA ARGHAM
... SABDA, as before.
[Praise]
Gods and asuras with their crowns
Bow down to your lotus feet.
Liberator from all problems,
Mother Tārā-homage to you!
Recitation
Visualize: At my heart, on a lotus and moon seat, is a white
wheel with eight spokes and a rim. At its hub, on a moon, is a
white TĀM, surrounded by 'OM please increase the life, merits
and wisdom-knowledge of myself, (n.), HĀ,' going clockwise,
while on the eight spokes are the eight syllables TĀ RE TU TTĀ
RE TU RE SWÄ. From the seed and mantra light-rays spread,
make offering to all the Gurus, Yidams, Buddhas and Bodhi-
sattvas of the ten directions, perform for all sentient beings such
benefits as increasing their lifetime, collect the compassion and
inspiration of all Buddhas, and dissolve back into the seed and
mantra, which become of blazing brilliance and splendor.
During the meditation session, recite the ten-syllable heart
mantra, OM TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE SWĀHĀ, remaining in this
visualization of spreading and returning.



Rinjung Gyatsa
239
At the end of the session, recite 108 times the augmented
mantra, OM TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE MAMA AYUR-PUNYE-IÑANA
PUSTIM KURU SWAHA. (Om O Tārā Tuttārā, Swift One, increase
my lifetime, merits and gnosis, svākā!) This is the all-purpose
mantra, and is the one used for continuous recitation (between
sessions).
(All dharmas comprising the visible world become the
mandala of Arya Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā. They all
dissolve into the guardian circle I visualized. I, the containing
[mandala environment and the contained [deities] dissolve also
into the TĀM syllable at the heart. This too dissolves part by
part, the loop into the head into the crescent into the dot into
the flame. The flame turns into the nature of clear light. Once
more I arise in the form of Arya-tārā, with Om at the brow, AĦ at
the throat and HOM at the heart. All things seen or heard are ul-
timately without true existence, their appearance illusion-like,
quite pure in the essence of a Gnosis deity.)
[Dedication of merit)
By this virtue, may I quickly
Realize White Tärä, and
Establish each migrating being,
Without exception, in her state!
Permission rite
Comprises permissions of Body, Speech and Mind; that of
Speech includes recitation-transmission for the mantra.
Cf. 3001: 160.438 is similar but with the hands reversed.
1. Sabda is generally spelled sapla in Tibetan transcription. Naivedye
('Food-offering Goddess') is more variable, here naiwite.
2. This is the standard form of the White Tārā mantra. The spelling
ayur-º is also common. Sometimes punye and jnana are inter-
changed, e.g. 438 and 3001: 160.
anticlockwise; on the middle one the consonants, clockwise;
and on the outer, the Heart of Dependent Arising, clockwise.
It is the augmented mantra that is recited as much as possible.
Permission rite: three transmissions, of recitation, inspira-
tion and vow.
6. Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā in the tradition of
Nyen Lotsawa (gNan-lugs-kyi sGrol-dkar yid-bżin 'khor-lo)
Out of Emptiness, from HÜM comes a guardian circle; in the
middle, from BHRUM, the physical world as a palace of moon-
crystal. In the center of this, on a lotus and moon seat, from TAM
appears myself, the goddess Tārā of the Wish-fulfilling Wheel,
exactly as 4.
Crown: Amitabha.
The wheel at the heart is also as 4 but in addition has on the
rim a garland of Oms.
Both the ten-syllable and augmented mantras are recited.
Permission: three transmissions, as 5; followed by 'washing,
cleansing and protection' (bkru-byabs-bsrun gsum), the last by
proclamation of the truth (bden-bdar).
7. Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā in the tradition of
Mahāpandita Vanaratna (Pan-chen Nags-rin lugs-kyi sGrol-
dkar yid-bzin 'khor-lo)
Visualization as 4, except that Tārā is crowned with Amitabha
and the wheel at the heart is triple-rimmed, as 5.1
It says in the text that only the all-purpose mantra, i.e. the
augmented one, is recited.
Permission: permissions of Body, Speech and Mind. That of
Speech includes three transmissions: recitation-transmission of
the mantra, and vow and inspiration transmissions.
1. Explicit description of the palace as 'square, four-gated, with all the
characteristics' is added.
2. Tär. 1.39.1-2, or possibly Vanaratna's text. No texts explicitly of
White Tärä are listed under Vanaratna in the Peking Tängyur index.
5. Wish-fulfilling-wheel White Tārā in the tradition of Bari
Lotsawa (Ba-ri lugs-kyi sGrol-dkar yid-bżin 'khor-lo)
As 4 but with the following differences.
She has two eyes, not seven. The upala she holds at her
heart divides into three branches, with three flowers by her ear,
respectively small and closed, opening, and fully developed,
symbolizing the Buddhas of the three times. Rather than
'proudly', she sits with upright body.
She is crowned with Amitabha.
The wheel visualized at the heart when reciting is similar
but with three rims. On the inner rim are the Sanskrit vowels,
8. White Sarasvati (dbyaris-can-ma dkar-mo)
Out of Emptiness, from BHRUM comes the vessel world, with
places used by hosts of devas, rşis, gandharvas and siddhas,
mountains, forests, and delightful lands of medicinal plants.
In its midst is a white, shining lake of milk, in which from
PAM comes the stem of a white lotus, fully developed, with a
hundred thousand petals, upon which from A comes a moon
disk and on that my mind as a white HRĪHM, which transforms
into myself, the goddess of sound, Sarasvati, white, with one

face and two arms. She has a crouching ardhu-paryanika posture.
Her face, like the full moon, is embellished with a pair of
darting eyes as bright as utpalas. Her left hand holds a vīnā
(Indian lute) of vaidūrya gemstone while the fingers of her right
hand play it, producing an ocean of musical sounds. Half
of her hair, as black as bees, is tied at the back of her neck,
and half is loose in individual strands, covering the upper part
of her body. Her topknot is bound with a garland of white
lotuses and the fringe of her hair adorned with various jewels.
She is like a sixteen-year-old, with prominent, full breasts, a
slender waist and a graceful, smiling manner. Her white scarf
of heavenly cloth and fluttering lower garments variegated like
a rainbow are moving. She is adorned with many ornaments
of precious gems, such as a jewel on top of the head, earrings,
choker, bracelets, anklets, rings, girdle, pendant necklace, long
necklace, and strings of little bells (on the feet).
Looking down, my heart is like a plantain flower; rising up,
it assumes the appearance of a red utpala in bloom, with a white
OM inside.
The Gnosis-being is drawn from Sarasvati in a grove of the
vidyadharas on a seashore in the south, and established in the
heart in the form of a 'wheel of vowels' (dbyars-con-gyi 'khor-
lo): 'a vast, eight-petaled white lotus, on whose center, green
with orange stamens, is an immaculate moon, and in the center
of this a white HRĪHM with a flame-like tip [to the anusvāra]
(näda), while on the eight petals are the (sixteen) vowels, two
on each, clockwise, like a garland of white lamps. After this,
the practice is visualization without recitation of a mantra, light
from the seed syllable and vowels eliminating ignorance and
increasing wisdom.
Permission: permissions of Body, Speech and Mind, and of
Qualities and Activities together.

flower opening beside her ear. She is smiling and very peaceful.
Her curly hair is tied on the left and hanging down, twisted,

back rests on a moon. A scarf of thin silk covers her breasts
and she wears a skirt of various silks. She is sitting in the lalita

Deities. Also, Kurukullä from the Hevajra-tantral in the tradi-
tion of Lalitavajra.
Out of Emptiness, the eight charnel grounds; amidst them,
from PAM comes a red lotus, on its center from RAM comes a
sun disk, on which is a red HRIHM, with long-mark and visarga.
From this spread light-rays like hooks and nooses, which make
offering to the Aryas, establish all sentient beings in the state
of the Venerable Lady, return and dissolve into the HRĪLIM,
transforming it into myself, Venerable Kurukullā, red, with one
face and four arms. The first pair draw a bow of flowers and
red-utpala-headed arrow to her ear; the other right hand holds a
summoning hook and the other left an utpala whose root forms
a noose. With fangs just showing, three eyes and full breasts,
she is like a sixteen-year-old. Her tawny hair streams upwards;
she is crowned with five dry skulls, has a long necklace of
fifty fresh [heads), is adorned with the five bone ornaments,
and wears a tiger-skin loincloth. She abides in ardha-paryanka
dancing posture, left leg extended, on a human corpse whose
head shows to her left, amid red light-rays and a blazing mass
of fire.
At her crown is om, at her throat Āł, at her heart HÜM. In
the center of her heart is a red utpala, and on a sun on its center
a red HRĪHM.
Abode: the Cave of Knowledge (Rig-byed-kyi phug = *Veda-

Recitation: visualize: on a sun at the heart is red HRIHM,
surrounded clockwise by the mantra. These gather the inspi-
ration of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and all the virtues of
samsāra and nirvana in the nature of red light-rays, dissolving
into me. Recite without distraction: OM KURUKULLE HRIHM

11. Red Sri Takkirāja (dPal Dod-rgyal dmar-po)
Tār: Takkirāja from the Three Red Deities.
Out of Emptiness, from PAM comes a red lotus with thirty-two
petals, on its center, from RAM a sun disk, and on this from
a red BURUM comes a semicircular mansion of ruby, with one
gate; in the middle of this, from PAM comes an eight-petaled
red lotus, on its center from RAM a sun disk, and upon this
my mind as a red HŪM. From this spread inconceivable light-
rays like hooks and nooses, which make offering the Aryas
and subjugate the world and all its beings, drawing them back
in the form of red light-rays to dissolve into the HŪM. This
melts into light and becomes myself, Takkiräja, ruby-red and
blazing with light, with one face, two arms and three eyes. His
right hand brandishes a hook, summoning the three worlds;
the left, with threatening forefinger, holds a noose at his heart.
He abides in pratyālīdha (right leg bent). He has a topknot of
tresses, is adorned with jewels and snakes, and wears a red silk
scarf and a skirt of various silks.
In his lap is the Mother, Increaser-of-Bliss (bDe-ba rgyas-byed-
ma = "Sukha-vardhani), red, with one face, two arms and three
eyes, her right hand brandishing a hook and her left holding
a flask full of nectar and embracing the Father. Her legs too,
in alīdha (right extended), are wound round the Father. Both
Father and Mother are amid a mass of blazing fire of Gnosis.
At the Father's heart is a red HŪM, encircled clockwise by the
mantra to be recited, also red.
Abode: Sukhāvati.
Crown: Amitabha.
Visualize: From the mantra-string surrounding the HŪM
at my heart, light-rays spread. They gather the subjugating
activity of all the Buddhas and all siddhis in the form of red light-
rays and absorb into the seed and mantra. Again light-rays
spread. From their tips come innumerable Takkirājas holding
hooks and nooses, who subjugate the three realms. Counting on
a rosary of red sandalwood or lotus over the ring finger, recite
twenty-five times each session the long (330 syllable) mantra:

14. The Sage of Vajrāsana (and his two atten-
dants] (Thub-pardo-rje-gdan Igtso-'khor-gsumx])
(a) Out of Emptiness comes a jewel throne supported in the four
cardinal directions by the four Māras and in the intermediate
directions by four lions. On it, on a lotus and moon disk, from
HUM comes a yellow vajra marked with HŪM, which transforms
into myself, the Sage of Vajrāsana (Vajrāsana-muni), the color
of refined gold, with one face and two arms, the right hand
touching the earth, the left in the gesture of concentration.

golden-colored TRAI. From this light spreads and reabsorbs,
transforming it into myself, the Lord King of the Array of the
Triple Samaya (bCom-ldan-'das Dam-tshig-gsum-bkod rgyal-po =
Bhagavan Trisamaya-vyaha-raja), a shining golden color, with the
attributes of a brahmacärin and complete with the Marks and

Offering the Seven Limbs
From The Vow of the Conduct of Bhadra (Bhadracari-prani-
dhina)
1. Homage to the Tathāgatas
a. With body, speech and mind together
1 To all the Lions of Men who in the three times
Have come into the world in the ten directions-
To all of them, without exception-1
Pay homage in faith with body, speech and mind.
15. Homage with the body
2 By virtue of the vow of Bhadra Conduct,
In the mental presence of all the Conqu’rors
I make prostration to them all by bowing
With bodies as many as th' atoms of their Lands.
1c. Homage with the mind
3 On one atom, Buddhas sit, as many
As the atoms, 'midst their Buddha-Children:
Thus I visualize the Dharma-realm 10
All entirely filled with Conquerors.
1d. Homage with the speech
4 In inexhaustible oceans of their praises,
With every sound from an ocean of vocal members
Proclaiming the virtues of all the Conquerors,
I give praise to all the Sugatas.
2. Making offering to them
a. Surpassable offerings
5 Superb flowers and garlands, instruments of
Music, unguents, finest parasols,
And the best of lamps and excellent incense
With these I make off'ring to the Conqu'rors.
6 Finest raiment and superb perfume,
Powdered incense equal to Mount Meru,
All the best of most distinguished splendor-
With these I make off'ring to the Conqu’rors.
21. Unsurpassable offerings
7 Off'rings that are vast and supreme I
Visualize for every Conqueror.
I, by power of faith in Bhadra Conduct,
Honor and make off'ring to all Conqu'rors.
3. Confessing one's faults
8 Whatever evil deeds I may have done
With body, speech, or likewise with the mind,
Under the power of greed, hate and delusion,
Every one of them do I confess.
4. Rejoicing in merits
9 Whatever merits all Conquerors, Buddha-Children,
Pratyekas, Aryas training and past training,
And worldly beings have, throughout the ten
Directions, I rejoice in all of them.
5. Lirging the Tathāgatas to turn the Wheel of Dharma
10 All (you] Lights of the Worlds of the ten directions,
Who have awakened to bodhi, and realized
Non-attachment: I urge all you Protectors
To turn the unsurpassable Wheel (of Dharma).
6. Requesting them to remain
11 Those who wish to demonstrate Nirvana,
I request with folded palms to stay
For eons as many as th' atoms of their Lands
For all beings' happiness and welfare.

7. Dedicating the roots of virtue one has gathered
12 Whatever little virtue I have gathered
From prostrating, offering, confessing,
And rejoicing, urging and requesting,
I dedicate it all towards Awakening.

Praise to Ho-shang
X quotes this verse with Pl. 34.
Inviting the Buddha and Elders, you asked
To be their patron for the Rains.
Tasting the nectar of their speech
You saw the Truth-Ho-shang, homage to you!
Be patron, spreading the supreme Doctrine
In the ten quarters until time ends!
Praise to the Four Great Kings
These verses are given in both R and X, although the color of

Very heroic, great in strength,
Blue in color, holding a sword,
Ruling the host of kumbhända demons,

2. Pander 1890: no. 210; Clark 1937: B289.
3. Dagyab 1977: 113-4. According to Dagyab he is an ordinary human

the reverse of 3001: 210 he is hailed as 'Noble Elder Ho-shang' just
like the actual Sixteen Elders. See also General Index.

5.
Le., though the Elders are actually Buddhas, and could teach Maha-
yāna, they appear as Arhants of the Lesser Vehicle, teaching the
Sravaka-yana, because many disciples are capable of practicing that
but not the Mahayana.

(bKa'-gdams lha-bzi'i nan-gi Śākya-thub-pa)
Out of Emptiness, from A at my heart comes a moon, on which
is a yellow HÜM, whose light fills my body. I become of the form
of the King of Sages (Thub-pa'i dhan-po = Munindra), the color
of refined gold, his right hand touching the earth and his left in
meditation, and sitting in vajra-paryanka. He has the attributes
of one gone forth (ie a monk) and all the Marks and Signs, and
wears the three robes of a monk. He radiates infinite light-rays.
His mind is in the nature of meditation.
At his heart on a moon is HUM.

fect Buddha! As follows: Om O medicine, medicine, great
medicine who has come forth, svaha!) One can recite just from
the OM onwards
The full set of seven Tathāgatas are not invoked in the sadhana
but only in the rite of Permission. In the preliminary visualiza-
tion to this rite, they sit in a line, three either side of Bhaisajya-
guru, with the two Bodhisattvas to his south-east and north-
east.
On the three lotus-and-moon seats to Bhaisajya-guru's right
are, in order:
(44) Tathāgata Abhijña-rāja ('King of Superknowledge'), red,
his right hand boon-granting and his left in meditation. (A
longer name is also given for him: Chos rgya-mtsho mchog-gi
blos rnam-par-rol-pa mnon-par-mkhyen-pa'i rgyal-po = *Dharma-

Lord Bhaisajya-guru (sMan-gyi bla, 'Medicine Guru'), King
of Vaidurya Light (Bai-durya 'od-kyi rgyal-po = Vaidurya-prabha-
raja), blue, with the attributes of one gone forth. His right
hand is boon-granting and holds in its palm a fully-developed
myrobalan; on his left, in meditation, he holds an almsbowl of
vidurya gemstone full of nectar. Wearing a monk's three robes
of red silk, he sits in vajra-paryarika on a lotus and moon, his
body complete with the Marks and Signs.
At his heart on a moon is a blue OM. From it spread light-
rays like hooks and nooses. Gnosis-being, VAJRA-SAMĀJAH! JAH

The body of the rite of Permission comprises recitation, vow
and inspiration transmissions. It begins with a visualization of
all seven Tathāgatas stacked vertically in the order presented,
from Bhaisajya-guru at the bottom to Sunāman at the top. Then
as one takes refuge in and prays to each one-
To the Lord, the Tathāgata, the Arhant, the Complete
and Perfect Buddha (n.) I pay homage, make offering
and go for Refuge. Just as the Sugata (n.) formerly
vowed, so may I and all sentient beings attain in a
moment!
---in inverse order, he dissolves into the one below. The longer
names given above come from these prayers.

(a) Out of Emptiness, from PAM comes a lotus, from A a moon,
on this a blue HÜM, whose light spreads out and returns so
it becomes myself, Tathāgata Nāgesvara-rāja ('King Ruler of
Nāgas'), the color of an unextracted jewel(?), his face white
and his body blue. He sits in vajra-paryanka, his two hands at
his heart making the gesture of removing sentient beings from
places of birth in the realms of woe. He is complete with the
Marks and Signs, wears the three dull red robes of a monk and
has the attributes of a brahmacárin. He has a back-rest of all
kinds of flowers and a sevenfold hood of snakes' heads.
(b) In front of him is Nivarana-viskambhin (sGrib-pa mnam-

Lord's face
In addition, to the right is a sangha of Bodhisattvas, to the left
a host of Arhants, and below a measureless host of någas.

Out of Emptiness, from HŪM come a vajra ground, wall, pavil-
ion, canopy and fire-mountain. Amid this guardian circle,
within a dharmôdaya are a lotus, sun and crossed vajra and a
palace. In the center of this, from the sixteen vowels twice
comes a moon and from the thirty-four consonants twice and
twelve vowels a sun, with HÜM on its center. With spread-
ing and returning, this becomes the great Vajra-holder (rDo-
rje-'chari = Vajradhrk, according to the mantra), blue, with three
faces, black, white and red, [and six arms]. The first pair of
arms, holding a vajra and bell, embrace his consort, Vajradhātv-

of human skin. He is in union with the Mother, Buddha-dakini
(Saris-rgyas mkha'-'gro-ma), who is red and similar to himself.
He has a crown of dry skulls, a garland of heads and the five
symbolic ornaments
Make mental offering to them. They dissolve into my heart

HÜM, becoming a vajra marked with HUM, which turns into
myself, Cakra-sambara ('Khor-lo bde-mchog), blue, with one
face, two arms and three eyes. Holding a vajra and bell and
embracing the Mother, he stands in alidha with his bent left
leg trampling Bhairava and his right, extended, Kälarätri. He
has a topknot of tresses, adorned with a wish-granting gem,
a crescent moon and a crossed vajra. He has the six symbolic
ornaments, a garland of heads and a tiger-skin loincloth and is
imbued with the nine dramatic sentiments.
(p) The Mother, Vajra-vārāhi (rDo-rje phag-mo), is red and
holds a knife and a skull. Her hair is loose and she has the five

lishes these deities in one's body: 56 at the heart, 57 in the
head, 58 on top of the crown, 59 at the shoulders, 60 at the eyes,
and 61 on the brow. Subsequently, one is allowed to visualize
them either that way, or in the mandala of six described above,
or individually. The body mandala of the 'armor' syllables of
these six deities is used in sadhanas 54 and 70, while the deities
themselves appear in 228.
Deviations: Vajrasattva on sun seat. Padma-nartêsvara

Front generation: (56) Out of Emptiness, from HÜM comes
a guardian circle; in its center, from PAM a five-petaled lotus,
on the center of which from OM HA? comes Vajrasattva, white,
with three faces-white, black and red-and six arms. The first
pair, holding a vajra and bell, embrace the Mother. The other
two left hands hold a skull full of nectar and a khatvanga, the
right a damaru and Brahma's head. He has a scarf of human
skin and abides on a moon.
On the petals, starting in front and going anticlockwise, are:

Sri-heruka, black, with a vajra; (60) from HÜM HÙM HO, Vajra-
sūrya ('Vajra Sun'), orange, with a jewel; and (61) from PHAȚ
HAM, Paramåśva ('Best of Horses'), green, holding a sword.
Each holds in his first pair of hands his personal sign and a bell
at his heart, and in the other pair, in the right hand a damaru
and in the left a skull and a khatvānga. They are on sun seats.
The principal and entourage are all adorned with the six
symbolic ornaments and have a crown of skulls, a long necklace
of heads and a tiger-skin loincloth. Each has three eyes and
abides in alidha posture (right leg extended) on a preta seat.
The concentration of the Father and Mother generates Innate
Joy (sahajananda). All the deities also experience Innate Joy,
and concentrate in the concentration of indivisible Great Bliss
and Suchness, whereby they delight them with the secret and
Suchness offerings.
Praise:
Vajrasattva, Heruka,
Vairocana and Vajra Sun,

guardian circle; in its center, from PAM a five-petaled lotus, on
the center of which from OM VAM comes Vajra-värähi, red, with
three faces, red, blue and green and six arms. Her three right
hands hold a knife, Brahma's head, and a hook; the three left a
skull, a khanga, and a noose.
On the petals, starting in front and going clockwise, are:

The principal either enters union with her consort, Vajra-

Do your duty and guard from obstructions!
Governed without impediment
By the four activities, homage to you!
Mantra: recite OM VAM, HAM YOM, IIRIM MOM, HREM HRIM,

Conferral: as 56-61. One visualizes oneself as Lady Vajra-
vārāhi, red, with one face and two arms, holding knife and
skull, and establishes these deities in one's body: 62 at the
navel, 63 at the heart, 64 at the throat, 66 in the head, 65 on
the crown and 67 on the brow. Subsequently one has the same
options as with 56-61. Visualizing this body mandala, with the
deities represented by their syllables, in the deities' colors, on
moon disks, is called 'putting on the armor'. It is used in the
sådhanas 54, 70, and 76 to 84, and with the actual deities rather
than the syllables in 228.
Deviation: Mohani on sun disk.

Concentrate a while on Emptiness.
(a) I am Sahaja-śrī-heruka (Lhan-cig-skyes-pa'i dpal he-ru-ka,
'Innate Glorious Heruka'), white as the autumn moon, with one
face and two arms, which hold a vajra and bell and embrace the
Mother. His legs are in alīdha, the bent left one trampling on
black Bhairava and the extended right on red Kalarātri. He has
three eyes, bared fangs, and a topknot of tresses adorned with
a wish-granting gem at its peak and a crossed vajra on the side.
(p) The Mother who is embracing him, Vajra-vārāhi (rDo-
rje phag-mo), is red, with one face, two arms and three eyes.
Her hair is loose and she has a crown of five dry skulls, a long
necklace of fifty fresh heads, and the five symbolic ornaments.
Her right hand holds a knife and her left a skull full of blood.
With her legs in pratyalidha (right bent), she is embracing the
Father.
Both are wrathful, amorous and youthful. Their bodies are of
complete bliss, [of the nature of] light, empty and like illusions,
They abide amid a blazing fire of Gnosis.
Concentrate a while, with the view that samsāra and Nirvana
and the whole physical and animate worlds are like me also.
Holding the reciting visualization, recite as much as possible
the mantra: OM HRIŇ HA HA HÜM HUM PHAT.2
At the end, cries of illusory joy from the motion of the private
parts of the visualized Heruka Father and Mother draw sentient
beings, who dissolve into us. We melt and transform into a HŪM
of the nature of Great Bliss, resembling pearl smeared with red
lead. The vowel sign dissolves into the body of the HA, that into
the head, that into the crescent, that into the dot, and that into
the flame, which remains, the size of a hundred-thousandth
part of the tip of a hair.
Out of Emptiness, I arise in an instant in the form of Sri-
heruka Father and Mother.
Conferral: rite of inspiration, including the four empower-
ments and a recitation transmission.
1. Hevajra-tantra, Ivii.27. The commentary glosses formation (oyaha,

signlessness, wishlessness and the absence of effort or accumulation
(of merit etc.).

great charnel grounds and the guardian circle. In the middle

a narrow root and large hood, domed on top like the back of a
tortoise. Inside this, speech is transformed into the syllables of
the mantra and the mind into the deities: from PAM, an eight-
petaled polylotus; on its center, a yellow human corpse whose
head is showing to the left; on the heart of this, from Om comes
a sun-disk, upon which is a red vam, Light-rays spread from
it, cleanse the stains of the three worlds and bring back all the
Conquerors of the ten directions, dissolving into it. It becomes
myself, Vajra-yogini, a rather dark ruby-red, with splendor like
the light of ten million suns. Her principal face is of goddess
aspect, smiling, imbued with passion and wrath, laughing and
with bared teeth. The right face is that of a pig, wrathful and
looking upwards. Her right hand brandishes a vajra knife, her
left holds a skull of blood at her heart. In her left armpit a white
vajra khatvānga stands upright. Her black, somewhat curly hair
hangs down loose in separate strands. She has three bright red,
round and darting eyes. Her garland of five dry skulls is strung
on a wreath of black vajras and she is adorned with a long,
hanging necklace of fifty blood-dripping human heads linked
with entrails and the five symbolic ornaments of human bone,
i.e. circlet, earrings, necklace, bracelets (and girdle). Naked,
youthful as a sixteen-year-old, and full-breasted, she stands in
ardha-paryanka dancing posture with left leg extended. With
a body possessing (the power for every manifestation, she is
amorous and playful amidst a blazing fire of Gnosis like the fire

In the center of a dharmôdaya, on a moon disk, is Am, which
transforms into VAM, the essence of my mind and of the blazing

80. Accomplishing (Artha-siddhi) Vārāhī (Phag-

Out of Emptiness comes a dharmôdaya, in the middle of which is
a four-petaled red lotus, on the center of this a sun disk, on this
a corpse, and on its heart my mind as a red HRĪLI, shining like
the fire at the end of the con. This transforms into myself, Vajra-
vārāhi, a red color like red lead, upon a lotus, sun and preta seat,
trampling on the three worlds in alidha (right leg extended) in
the manner of a wrestler's throw (gyad-kyi dor-stabs-kyis). She
has one face with three eyes, contracted in a frown, very fierce,
a terrifying, very wrathful pig's face. She blazes with vajra
fire-light and her tongue is vibrating. Her brown head hair
twists upward and her body hair and pubic hair stand erect.
Dwarfish and pot-bellied, she is adorned with five dry skulls
on the brow and a garland of blood-dripping heads on the
body, and beautified with the five symbolic ornaments. She
is naked and four-armed, the right hands holding a vajra and
a vajra hook, the left a blood-filled skull and, with threatening
forefinger, a noose. In her armpit is a khatvanga. She is laughing
a laugh hard for any vicious being to bear and stands amidst a
blazing mass of fire.

Out of Emptiness, at my navel from RAM spread light-rays. My
body becomes a red, triangular dharmôdaya, in the center of
which, on a white, four-petaled lotus, is my mind as a sun on
top of a moon and in the center of the sun and moon disks three
HRĪLIS, which become three knives marked with HRIH. All this
blends together and transforms into [three deities).

Deviations: color of hair; khatvārgas for 82 and 83 not
mentioned
1. Cf. P 2262-3/Toh. 1554-5 Chinnamuunda-(vajravárāhī)-sādhana, am-
ong the Six Värähi Texts; also P 4669 (Toh, not identified) and
P5130/Toh. 3300.
2. Cf. Sm 233.
(81) In the center is Buddha-dākini (Sans-rgyas mkha'-'gro-
ma), orange, in alidha (right leg extended), trampling on
Bhairava and Kälarätri, her right hand outstretched downward
and holding a knife, her left holding up a blood-filled skull. At
her left armpit is a white khatvānga, of the nature of Method.
(82) On the left is Vajra-varnanī, green, in pratyalidha (left leg
extended), her right hand holding a knife and her left a skull.
(83) On the right is Vairocani, yellow, in alīdha (right leg
extended), her right hand holding a knife and her left a skull.
All three have a crown of five dry skulls, a hanging garland
of fifty fresh [heads), and the five symbolic ornaments. They are
naked and three-eyed, their black hair loose in separate strands.
With unbearable faces, wrathful and contracted, terrifying even
the terrible, they abide amid a blazing mass of fire.
In the private place of each is a dharmôdaya with her mantra
inside: (81) OM SARVA-BUDDHA-DAKINI HUM PHAT SWÄHA,
(82) OM VAJRA-WARNNANIYE HUM PHAT, (83) OM VAJRA-VAIRO-
CANĪYE HÜM PHAȚ. The syllables are all stacked up.
With the knife in her right hand, the principal deity cuts off
her own head; the hand holding the skull grasps half the hair,
with the three eyes looking downwards. From the severed
central channel in her neck, a jet of mixed white and red
bodhicitta pours into her own mouth; from the left channel,
lalana, a jet of 'semen' (kunda) mixed with Aksobhya pours into
the mouth of the left deity, and from the right channel, rasand,
menstrual blood (rajas) mixed with ordinary blood pours into
the mouth of the right one. Visualize this clearly and intensely
for as long as possible. Then light-rays from the mantra in the
private place draw the right and left goddesses back through
the side channels to become indivisible with oneself.
Another generation, in front, has the armor syllables as 76.

Conferral: rite of inspiration, as 76. This mentions some
symbolic meanings:
The cutting of Chinna-mundā's three channels symbolizes
the cutting of the three poisons. The three goddesses are the
three Buddha-bodies (kaya). The knives are Wisdom, Empti-
ness; the skulls Method, Great Bliss. The extended right leg
shows that through compassion, she does not abide in Nirvana;
the bent left, that through understanding she does not abide in
samsāra. In short, the whole thing is of the nature of Union.

Out of Emptiness, the syllables E-WAM, vast and capacious, in
the center of which from PAM comes a polylotus and from white
AM a sun disk. On this is my mind as a white HUM. From it all,
light-rays spread and return, transforming it into Lady Vajra-
yoginī, white, with one face, two arms and three eyes as red
as bandhuka flowers. Frowning and baring her fangs, she has
an extremely angry expression. She is naked and her hair is
loose. Her right hand, pointing a vajra-marked knife or a vajra,
frightens all asura demons. Her left, entwined round the left
leg, holds up a skull full of nectar, from which her upturned
mouth drinks. In space above are hosts of Tathāgatas, male and
female in amorous union, from which red and white nectars
pour into the skull, giving the flask empowerment. On her
shoulder lies a khutpānga marked with a vajra. Her right leg,
outstretched to the seven underworlds, tramples on Bhairava
and Kälarātri. Her raised left leg, stretching to the realm of
Brahma, tramples Brahma and Sakra into the worlds above. She
is without ornaments. Nectar pours from her mouth. Sending
out from her body countless Vajra-yoginīs similar to herself,
with Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and wrathful male and female
deities, she abides amid a mass of blazing fire, surrounded by
the eight great charnel grounds and an outer guardian circle.
Emitting from my navel a single HOM, I emanate in front a
messenger Vajrapāņi in Heruka aspect, his right hand holding
a vajra and his left a dagger. He emits countless secondary
emanations holding hooks and nooses, summoning all the hin-
dering demons such as Mahāvisņu and Narasimha, throwing
them into a vajra well produced from HUM, stabbing them with
the dagger and reducing them to dust with the vajra.

Out of Emptiness comes my body as a guardian circle, eight
charnel grounds and mansion, with in the center a four-petaled
polylotus seat. My mind is the complete circle of deities, as
follows.
(89) In the middle of the central lotus is the Lady whose
body is the darkness of time, very wrathful and passionate. At
her armpit she holds a khatänga, of the nature of Method. Her
principal face, symbolizing conventional truth, is that of a very
wrathful goddess; her upper face, symbolizing the Ultimate,
is a pig's, on the right and turned upwards. She is three-eyed
and adorned with a tiger-skin loincloth, snakes and bones. She
has pale yellow, upward-streaming hair, a crown of five dry
human heads and a long necklace of fifty fresh ones. Her right
hand brandishes a knife, her left holds a blood-filled skull at
her heart. She stands in ardha-paryanka dancing posture with
left leg extended, on the heart of a human corpse upon a sun.
She is youthful and abides amid a blazing mass of fire.
A variant tradition has her wearing a scarf of human skin.
On the four petals are flasks full of nectar, their mouths
stopped with blood-filled skulls.
In the gates and intermediate directions are: (90) in the east,
Vajra-dākini, white; (91) in the south, Ratna-dākini (Jewel D),
yellow; (92) in the west, Padma-dākini (Lotus Dº), red; (93) in
the north, Karma-dakini (Action Dº; an offering mantra gives

the left; (95) in the south-west, Viśva-dākini (Universal D),
yellow on the right and red on the left; (96) in the north-west,
Sarva-dākini (Totality D"), red on the right and green on the
left; and (97) in the north-east, Loka-dākini (World Dº), green
on the right and white on the left. These are one-faced and
without sun seats, but otherwise similar to the principal deity.
At the crown is Guru Heruka; at the heart, the Gnosis-being,
with one face; in the belly, the four Heroes; and at the navel,
a four-spoked wheel with the Lady on the hub and the four
dakinis on the spokes. At the crown is Āł, on the right shoulder
HA, on top of the right foot RI, on top of the left NI, and on the
left shoulder SA. The heart cakra is sealed with A, the crown
with HA, the throat with NI, the navel with Ri and the genital
with SA.

the youthfulness of a sixteen-year-old, three eyes like handhuka
flowers, and shoots' of teeth just showing. Her right hand
brandishes a red, five-pointed vajra marked with three flags;
her left holds at her heart a skull filled with the blood of the

four Māras, offering it to her mouth. With a crown of five dry
human heads and a long necklace of fifty fresh ones, naked, and
adorned with the five symbolic ornaments, she abides proudly

amid a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis.
She is crowned with Aksobhya.
From HRĪH at my throat comes a red lotus with sixteen petals.
In its center is a tongue and from HŪM a red, five-pointed vajma
with OM VAJRA-JIHWA RAKSA RAKSA SWĀHA at its center. On the

lugs)
Out of Emptiness, in space at the level of my heart appears a
white HRĪH, which melts into a large white drop in the middle
and a small white drop either side. These transform into the
principal deity and two attendants, as follows.
(101) In the center is Arya-avalokitesvara ('Phags-pa sPyan-
ras-zigs dban-phyug), white like the rising sun on a snowy
mountain, with the splendor of a hundred thousand autumn
moons. He has one face and four arms, the first pair with
palms joined forming a hollow at his heart, the other right
holding a rosary of pearls and the other left an eight-petaled
white lotus, with stem, opening beside his ear. His whole face
is very peaceful and smiling, his two eyes looking at the ground
a fathom in front with the sattva gaze. His hair is bound on the
top of his head in a topknot of tresses, half of it twisted above the
two knots, the ends moving in the wind. He wears a deerskin
covering his left breast, a scarf of various silks, and a red lower
garment, and is adorned with all the jewel ornaments. He sits in
vajra-paryanka with the attributes of a monarch and complete in
the Marks and Signs. He is crowned with Amitabha. Emitting
infinite light and radiance, he manifests upon a lotus and full-
moon seat
(100) On his right is Mani-dhara ('Gem-holder'), yellow, his
first pair of hands with folded palms, his second right holding
with joined thumb and forefinger the mighty king of jewels
(rin-po-che dban-gi rgyal-po= *ratnêndra-rāja), with a handle, and
the second left a branch of jewel twigs with the property of
dropping ears of fruit
(102) On the left is Şad-aksari ('Six-syllable-lady'), similar to
the principal but with the attributes of a goddess, of charming
manner.
Both attendants are looking at the face of the principal and
have one knee on the ground.
Instead of a white lotus, he can be holding a white utpala.
All three deities can be either with or without seats.
At my heart, from comes a full moon and on this a white
HRIH
Mantra: OM MANI-PADME HOM.
(Between sessions, never be separate from love and
compassion.)
Praise:
You whom all the Buddhas praise,

Out of Emptiness, from A at my heart comes a moon, on which
is a white HRĪH. Light from this fills my body and I become
Avalokita, white, with one face and four arms, the first pair at
my heart with palms folded, the second right holding a crystal
rosary and the second left the stem of a white utpala. He is
seated in vajra-paryanka. On the surface of his topknot of tresses
is Amitabha. He is adorned with silks and jewels, and in every
pore of his body are countless Buddha-lands.
At his heart, on a moon, is HRIĘ.
Visualizing the seed with the mantra string, meditate on
great compassion towards sentient beings and recite OM MANI-
PADME HUM.
Conferral: by recitation-transmission.
101, 103: see also 435, 3001: 89.
The principal face is white, the right green and the left red; the
three faces above these green, red and white; the three above
these red, white and green. These are all peaceful faces, of
amorous aspect. Above them is a wrathful, black face with
yellow, upward-streaming hair, and above that the red face of
Buddha Amitabha, with an uşnīsa. The first principal hands
are at the heart, palms folded. The second right holds a rosary;
the third is boon-granting, raining a stream of nectar from its
palm, to eliminate the hunger and thirst of pretas; and the fourth
holds a wheel. The second left hand holds a white lotus with
eight petals, the third a water-pot, and the fourth a bow and
arrow. The remaining 992 hands are extended in the gesture of
granting boons. In the palm of each hand is an eye. Standing
with feet together, he is adorned with a new cotton skirt, a
deerskin covering his left breast and all the jewel ornaments.
His body is complete with all the Marks and Signs and emits
innumerable light-rays.
At his brow is OM, at his throat Ah, at his heart HIŪM, and at
the center of his heart on a moon is HRIH.

Out of Emptiness, from PAM comes an eight-petaled lotus,
on the center of which from A comes a moon and on this
HRĪy. Light spreads and returns, it becomes a golden lotus,
its center marked with HRIH. From this innumerable light-rays
like hooks and nooses spread and draw back all Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas, who dissolve into it, transforming it into myself,
Arya-avalokita, white as the autumn moon, with eleven faces.

Tār.: Five-deity Khasarpana Avalokita (sPyan-ras-gzigs "kha-
sarpa-ni Tha-Ina).
(a) Out of Emptiness, my mind rests on a moon as a white
HRĪLI, which transforms into myself in the form of glorious Kha-
sarpana (mKha'-spyod,'Air-gliding) Ārya-avalokita, the color of
an immaculate moon and crowned with Conqueror Amitabha.
From his right hand, granting boons, pours a stream of nectar,
satisfying all who have craving. His left thumb and ring finger
hold at his heart the root of the stem of a white lotus, which
opens beside his ear. He sits in ardha-paryanka lalita posture
with right leg extended. Smiling and with a topknot of tresses,
he is complete with all the Marks and Signs such as having two
beautiful eyes as broad as lotus petals. A deerskin covers his
left breast, the lower part of his body is wrapped in white silk
and he is adorned with all the ornaments. His body blazing

His eyebrows, beard and hair stream upwards. On top of his
head he has a green horse's head. His right hand is raised in
homage and his left holds a white vajra staff, OM-piercing, He

posture is preferred, standing, sitting, etc.
At my crown, on a moon, is om; at my throat, on a pink

upon this on a moon, HRĪLI.
Praise: as 104.
Mantra: OM HRIH SWÄHA. Recite with visualization of
countless bodies of the deity spreading from the HRĪH at the
heart, raining jewels and nectar on every world, teaching
sentient beings the Dharma and establishing them in the state

Permission: permissions of Body, Speech and Mind; in the

The principal is equivalent to 105a, 436 and 3001: 147. In
Sm, the same form alone or with Tarā and Hayagriva only is
called Lokanātha (Sm 8, 19, 18), and only the five-deity group
is Kha-sarpana (Sm 13-16, 24, 26) (IyA).

2. The markings on Earth's Moon (our 'Man in the Moon') are consid-

3. As Sm 13, 16, 24, 26.
The Blue Annals record that the siddha Mitra-yogin, invited to
Tibet by Tr'op'u Lotsawa (Khiro-phu lo-tsi-ba), taught a long series
of practices centered on Avalokita, collected under the title Mi-
Ira brgya-rtsa. Its list of contents (BA 1035–39) includes, among
ten Preliminary Practices in the Benefiting Others section of the
second (Inner) Cycle, one called 'Resting the Mind' (Sems nal-so-ba)
doubtless the same that appears as the Tg text P3569/Toh. 2748.
When Tr'op'u Lotsawa transmits the practice to a disciple it is called
Sems-nid nal-gso) (BA 677). How the change from sems ('the mind')
to sems-lid ("Mind-as-such') could have occurred is a mystery, as it
is hardly conceivable a lama could confuse the two. It may be that
the popularity of Longchenpa's treatise was responsible, and that
the reference at BA 677 is anachronistic.
2. R; Rk kha-sarpani.
115, 117. Mind at Rest' Khasarpana (Kha-sarpa-ni2

Out of Emptiness, on a lotus and moon seat I appear in an
instant as Venerable Kha-sarpana, white, with one face and two
arms, the right hand boon-granting, the left resting on the seat
and holding an eight-petaled white lotus with a stem. He sits in
ardha-paryanka lalita posture with right leg extended. Adorned
with silks and jewels, his left breast covered by a deerskin, his
body sends out five-colored light-rays, benefiting myself and
all sentient beings.
Recite: OM ĀH HRIH HŪM.
Permission: permissions of Body, Speech and Mind and a
recitation-transmission.
(Lineage: through Mitra-yogin and Tr'op'u Lotsawa.)
Cf. 436.
1. Nothing in the body of the sādhana or permission indicates any
connection with the name Sems-nid nal-gso, 'Mind at Rest', which
is best known as the title of a treatise by the Nyingma teacher
Longchen Rapjampa (klon-chen rab-'byams-po, 1308-63; see, e.g.,
NSTB, 1: 575-596).
116. Five-deity Wish-granting-gem (Cintamani)
Avalokita (sPyan-ras-gzigs yid-bzin nor-bu lha-

(According to the tradition of Atīša.)
From YAM RAM VAM LAM SUM come the four elements and
Mount Meru. (a) On the summit, from PAM comes an eight-
petaled lotus; on its center, from A a moon, and on this HRĪH.
Light spreads and returns and it becomes Arya-avalokita, red
in color. His first pair of hands hold the stem of and open a
red lotus, the second pair hold a rosary and a water-pot (Tib.
ghundhe, = kundi). He sits in vajra-paryarika, adorned with a
deerskin and all the ornaments and crowned with Amitabha.
At his heart, on a moon, is a vajra, and at its hub a lotus
marked with HRĪĦ. From this emanate four goddesses, who are
set on the petals in the four directions.
(b) In the east, from HA, Vajra-pāší (rDo-rje zags-pa-ma),
holding a noose and a gem. (c) In the south, from TRAM, Vajra-
ratna (rDo-rje rin-chen-ma), holding a gem and a bell. (d) In
the west, from HRIH, Ekajatā (Ral-gcig-ma), holding a lotus and
a rosary. (e) In the north, from ȚA, Bhrkuți (Khro-għer-ma),
holding a crossed vajra and a water-pot (ghundhe). All four are
red and adorned with deerskins and all the ornaments and sit
in vajra-paryanka.
Visualizing at the heart a six-spoked wheel with the near-
heart mantra on the hub and spokes and the root mantra on the
rim, recite both mantras.

arms and is just a little wrathful. He is three-eyed. His right
hand holds rosary of pearls, his left holds the stem of a lotus
and embraces the Mother. Adorned with bone ornaments, he
abides in pratyalidha posture (left leg extended).
(p) The Mother who embraces him is Guhya-jñāna-dakini

and holding a damaru and a blood-filled skull. She is similar to
Vajra-vārāhi.

on the center of which is the Arya Eleven-faced One. His
principal face is white, etc. (as 104, up to:) In the palm of each
hand is an eye. He sits in vajra-paryanka.
On the eight petals, from HRĪHs on each appear the eight
Arya-avalokitas Protecting from the Eight Perils (Asta-bhaya-

1. Numerous sixth-century images Avalokita Protecting from the
Eight Great Perils are found at Ajanta (Ghosh 1980: 23). Later
the role was taken over by Tārā. Although Tärä Saving from the
Eight Perils is not depicted in the present work, the theme recurs
throughout IPT.
According to Tār., this was an oral instruction of Atīša.

Bari Lotsawa (Gos-sħon-can ba-ri lugs).
In my heart on a sun is a blue HŪM, from which light-rays
spread, filling me from the top of my head to the soles of my feet.
My ordinary body and my sins and obscurations are purified
and I become Vajrapāni, standing in pratyalidha posture (right
leg bent) on a lotus and sun seat. He is blue, with one face and
two arms, the right hand brandishing skywards a five-pointed
bajra, the left raising a threatening forefinger at the heart. He
has three round, red eyes and yellow, upward-streaming hair,
is adorned with the eight great nāgas and jewels and wears a
tiger-skin loincloth. Crowned with Aksobhya, he abides amid
a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis.
If you wish to do the recitation, visualize in your heart on a
sun, HÜM surrounded by the mantra-string. Light-rays spread,
purify one's sins and obscurations, overcome hindrances, make
offering to the Aryas, benefit sentient beings, return with all
inspirations and dissolve back into the seed and mantra-string.

places of myself and the front generation appears Lord Vajra
Fierce One (Vajra-canda), dark blue, with one face, two arms
and three eyes, his beard, eyebrows and hair blazing like fire,
and with sharp, bared fangs. His right hand brandishes a five-
pointed vajra, his left rests a bell on his side. In pratyalıdha, he
tramples with his bent right leg on Iśvara and with his extended
left on Umā (dbu-ma??). He wears a tiger-skin loincloth. White
serpents form his crown, yellow ones his earrings and armlets,
red ones his necklace and girdle, black ones his anklets and
sash, and green ones his bracelets.
OM VAJRA RAKŞA RAKŞA HŪM. On my crown is a crossed
vajra marked with HŪM, which gives out a coat of vajra armor,
reaching the soles of my feet. From their names and OM HRIH
HUM TRAM A respectively come Garudas of the Five Families
at the five cakras, the Wheel (Buddha), Lotus, Vajra, Jewel and
Action Garudas, with their respective emblems (a sword for
Action Garuda) (white, red, blue, yellow, green). From E VAM
MA YA come Flower, Incense, Lamp and Perfume Garudas
(probably female), at the sides and shoulders, red, blue, red
and green respectively. From A SWA HRĪLU TÜM come Yakşa-,
Yāma-, Nāga- and Gandharva-subduing Garudas, with sword,
club, chain and vajra, at the lower chest, shoulder-blades, belly
and lower back (blue, unstated, red, green). From JAHHÜM VAM
HOì come Hook, Noose, Chain and Bell Garudas, at the nose,
mouth, genitals and anus (white, yellow, red and sky-blue). All
the garudas hold their own emblem in the right hand and a
snake of their own color in the left, offering it to their mouth.
Initially they have one face and two arms, but with further
mantras one becomes covered with innumerable garudas with
many faces and arms, all blazing with fire.
At my heart on a lotus and sun is HÜM, surrounded by mantra
strings.
He is crowned with the Five Families, Aksobhya being the
chief.

Out of Emptiness, from OM VAJRAPĀNI HUM PHAT! I appear as
the Vajra Fierce One, dark blue, with one face, two arms and
three eyes and bared fangs, the right hand brandishing skyward
a yellow, five-pointed vajra and the left extending a threatening
forefinger, overcoming hindrances. In pratyalīdha posture (left
leg extended) on a polylotus and sun, he is adorned with black
snakes and complete with the ornaments and garb of a wrathful
deity. Every pore filled with dark blue garudas, he abides amid
a blazing mass of fire. The threatening forefinger can also be at
his heart.
If you wish principally to subdue nagas, visualize him tramp-
ling snakes of the five families beneath his feet. Generate the
divine pride that not merely the haughty but the Gnosis deities
are at his command.
On his crown is Guru Aksobhya.
In the middle of the heart on a sun is a blue HÜM surrounded
by the mantra. From these, fire blazes clockwise, filling the
body and burning up sins and obscurations. Merging with the
fire outside, it burns brightly and puts an end to all enemies and
hindrances. Light-rays from the HÜM produce a vajra palace and
a guardian circle.
Recite: OM VAJRA-CANDA-MAHĀROSAŅA HUM PHAT.
Then visualize on the tip of the left forefinger a black garuda,
holding up a black snake. Recite the mantra with GARUDA CALE

161. Vajrapāņi Spirit-subduer (Phyag-rdor 'byun-po

Out of Emptiness, from URIH comes an eight-petaled lotus, on

Vajrapāņi Spirit-subduer (Bhūta-dāmara), as black as kohl, with
three round, red eyes, gaping mouth, rolled-up tongue, bared

The first pair of hands, at the heart, make the spirit-subduing
gesture (see 501). The other right hand brandishes a flaming
vajra, the other left threatens with a threatening forefinger and
a noose. His legs, in pratyalīdha (right bent), trample elephant-

Tār.: Kneeling, Two-armed, Blue Acala, remover of internal
obstacles among the six Vajrasana Yidam Deities.
Out of Emptiness comes my body as a mass of light. In my heart,
from PAM comes a lotus, from RAM a sun, on this a radiant blue
HUM. Light-rays spread from it, filling my body and cleansing
all sins and obscurations. Again they spread, benefit sentient
beings, and return, transforming it into myself in the form of the
Exceedingly Fierce One (gTum-po chen po = Canda-maha-rosana),
blue like a flax flower or black like the cloud at the end of time.
He has one face and two arms, the right hand brandishing
skyward a sword of Gnosis, the left pressing to his heart a
vajra noose wound twice round his threatening forefinger. He
abides in standing posture with his left knee and right sole
on the polylotus and sun seat. He has three round, red eyes,
the right gazing up, annihilating Māra, the left gazing down,
subduing asura and nāga demons, and the middle one gazing
straight forwards, overcoming all obstructors on the surface of
the earth. His face is contracted in a frown with exceeding
fury and wrath and he bares his fangs, his upper teeth pressing
his lower lip. He has yellow hair tied in a topknot and five
knots and is crowned with Akşobhya Buddha. With a skirt of
assorted silks, jewel ornaments, and a long necklace (se-ral-kha)
of white snakes, he has a most terrible body and abides amid
blazing fire of Gnosis.
(He can also have black hair. If you want to subdue någa
demons in particular, it is taught, he kneels on the right knee
and has a tiger-skin loincloth, a crown of dry skulls, and the
eight great nāgas as ornaments.)
At his heart is a Gnosis-being similar to himself, a finger-
breadth high, and at his heart the Concentration-being, a HUM
on lotus and sun, the size of a grain of corn, surrounded by
the mantra. Light from this cleanses my sins and obscurations,
annihilates all hindering demons, and exhorts all the Buddhas
to send their inspiration in the form of light-rays, which dissolve
into me.

Hey there! Though the two extremes don't move you,

Tār: Manjuśrī known as the one practiced with the Yönten
Yeshe Zangpo (Guna-jñana-bhadra) hymn ("Jam-dpal Yon-tan
ye-ses bzar-po'i bstod sgrub-lu grags-pa).
Out of Emptiness, on a lotus and moon an orange wheel with
five spokes. On its hub is DHIH, on the spokes A-RA-PA-CA-NA.
Light-rays spread from it, return and transform it into Arya-
manjusri, both myself and in space in front of me. Both bodies
are saffron-colored, holding a sword and a book, seated in vajra-
paryanka, adorned with silks and jewels, and complete with the
Marks and Signs
At my heart on a lotus and moon is an orange wheel, as
before. At the heart of the front-generation is DHIH.
Visualizing: light-rays from my heart manifest innumerable
offerings and I make offering and request to the Manjughosa in
front; recite twenty-one times or more:
Since with intelligence clear and pure,
Like a sun without clouds, of the two obscurations,
You see as they are all objects of
The two truths, you hold at your heart a book.
You love like an only child ev'ry migrator
Afflicted with suffering, groping in darkness
Of ignorance in the jail of Becoming.
Your speech has the sixty qualities, roaring
Like thunder to rouse from the sleep of defilements.
To free from the chains of karma, eliminate
Darkness of ignorance, and cut every
Sprout of suff'ring, you bear a sword.
Primordially pure, your body, transcender
Of the Ten Stages, chief Conquerors' Son,
Is perfect in virtues, and bedecked
With the hundred and twelve adornments,
Eliminator of my mental darkness,
Manjughosa-to you I bow.
At the end, visualize the Manjughosa in front melts into
light and dissolves into me. The wheel at my heart spins rapidly.
Recite 108 times or more: OM ARAPACANA DHIH.
Finally, meditate on Emptiness, and dedicate the merits.

189. White Mañjughoṣa of the Wisdom Wheel
(Jan-[dbyans) dkar-Ipol šes-rab 'khor-lo)
Tar. adds: Instruction of the Great Pandita of Kashmir (Kha-che
pan-chen-gyi man-viag).
Out of Emptiness, from PAM comes a lotus and from A a moon,
upon which from DAH comes a sword whose hilt and point
are marked with vajras, adorned with DHĪH. Its light turns the
physical world into a mansion and the beings into Manjuśrī.
The inspiration of all Gurus, Yidams, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas
and learned and accomplished Aryas returns in the form of
light-rays and transforms it into White Manjughosa, his right
hand brandishing a white sword and his left holding pressed
to his heart an upala marked with a book and a wheel. He
is in vajra-paryarika and has all the characteristics of peaceful
Manjusri.
At his heart on a moon is a white, eight-spoked wheel with
DHIH on the hub and the eight syllables of the mantra on the
spokes.
The Gnosis-being is invoked from Akanistha and dissolves
into the DHIH, which becomes a Gnosis-being similar to myself,
with at his heart the Concentration-being, another DHĪH on a
moon.
Conferral: a simple, unnamed rite involving purifying the
Body, Speech and Mind with light from the Master's three
places.

Tār: Manjuśrī Lion of Debaters, chief Yidam deity of D'ampa
Sang-gye.
Out of Emptiness, in the principal's place and in front of it, from
PAMS come lotuses, from As moon disks. (a) On the principal's
lotus and moon seat, from SIM comes a blue lion, its head to the
right with upturned face and freely-hanging tawny mane, lying
down. On it, on a lotus and sun, is a DHIụ the color of young
saffron, while on the seat in front is a sky-blue HRIH. The seed
transforms into myself, Venerable Mañjughoșa, like a mass of
red lead in color. His two hands make the gesture of explaining
the Dharma; from between the thumbs and forefingers spring
the stems of utpalas, which open beside his ears, with a sword on
the right one and a book on the left. He has the youthfulness of
a sixteen-year-old. With five knots of hair, he sits in the posture
of royal dignity upon the lion, adorned with silks and all the
jewel ornaments, peaceful, smiling and of graceful appearance.
(b) In front is Arya-sarasvatī, sapphire blue, with all the at-
tire of a goddess, in crouching ardha-paryanka posture, proud
with the pride of an illusory woman. All her other characteris-
tics are the same as the Father's.
Both are crowned with Aksobhya.
Praise:
Wearer of a youthful aspect,
Lamp of Gnosis shining bright,
Dispeller of the three worlds' darkness,
Mañughoșa-homage to you!

Follows 191 in R.
Out of Emptiness, upon a white lotus with stem is another white
lotus, with three petals, on which from A comes a moon. On
this is my mind as a white om, which sends out five-colored
light-rays and turns into a white lotus marked with OM. From
this, light-rays spread, return and transform it into myself, Lady
Prajñā-paramita ("Perfection of Wisdom'), white as the autumn
moon, with one face and two arms, seated in vajra-paryanka.
Her hair, as black as bees, is twisted to the left. Her hands make
at her heart the gesture of explaining the Dharma. From the
right palm grows the root of a white lotus, from the left that
of a red one; both open beside her ears and have books of the
Perfection of Wisdom on them. With slim waist and full breasts,

Out of Emptiness, from PAM comes a lotus and from A a
moon, on which I appear in an instant as the Mother of all
the Buddhas of the three times and the ten directions, Prajfia-
pāramitā, yellow, in vajra-paryarika. Her first pair of hands are
explaining the Dharma and in meditation, the other pair hold
a book and a rosary. She is complete in all the characteristics of
a goddess
At her heart is a six-spoked wheel with a white A at the hub
and the six parts of the mantra, TAD-YATHĀ: GATE GATE PARA-
GATE PARA-SAMGATE BODHI SWĀHĀ, on the spokes, clockwise.
My body is empty of appearance, my speech empty of
sound, my mind empty of knowing. With the motivation of
compassion for sentient beings who do not realize this, recite
the mantra strongly, visualizing that it purifies all the sins and
obscurations of oneself and of the beings of the six destinies.
Between sessions, read the Perfection of Wisdom sütras, make
prostrations and offerings to the books, recite her hundred and
eight names, etc.
No permission is necessary, conferral by meditation-trans-
mission alone being sufficient.

Nirrti-pāda (rJe-btsun Byams-pa Ni-ri-ti-pa'i lugs)
Precedes 191 in R.
Out of Emptiness, on a lotus and moon seat is my mind as
a golden-colored MAIM, which transforms into a branch of a
nāga-tree marked with a water-pot and with MAIM. With light
spreading and returning, this becomes myself, Arya-maitreya,
golden-colored, complete with all the Marks and Signs. His
right hand at his heart is explaining the Dharma, his left in the
meditation position holds the root of a nāga-tree branch, whose
flower opens beside his ear and has a water-pot on it. The
surface of his topknot of tresses is adorned with a caitya. He
has a deer-skin covering his left breast and a sacred thread, and

intelligence. She dissolves into my heart. Amid a mansion of
four kinds of jewels I become Sarasvati, her body and three faces
white, her first pair of hands holding a sword and an utpala and
the other pair supporting a vīnā. She sits in vajra-paryanka on
a lotus and moon, youthful as a sixteen-year-old and adorned
with silks and jewels.

12. THE FIVE VAJRĀSANA YIDAM DEITIES
[General remarks)
(These five complete a set of six, begun with Kneeling, Blue
Acala (173).)
(Ācārya Vajrāsana's six Yidam deities comprise: (1) to pacify
external obstacles such as enemies, Märīci; (2) to pacify internal
obstacles such as hindering demons, Kneeling Blue Acala; (3) to
pacify diseases, the goddess Buddha-locanā; (4) to avert such
obstacles as bad dreams, Three-and-a-half-syllable Avalokita;
(5) to achieve long life, the Sage of Meru Peak; and (6) to cleanse
sins and obscurations, meditation and recitation of the Tathagata
[Tri-samaya-vyuhal's hundred-syllable mantra.)
1. Tär. also mentions these functions and the affiliation to the six
Vajrasana Yidams in his titles for the individual sadhanas.
golden-colored and slim, her right hand holding a needle and
her left a thread, standing with feet together. She emerges from
my right nostril and remains in front of me.
Visualize: she emanates countless female messengers similar
to herself, who summon helplessly all those who do harm, sew
up their mouths and eyes, bind their limbs and throw them into
a pit outside the wall.
Recite once the Arya-mārici-nama-dharani (P 182/Toh.564),
repeating seven times the actual heart mantra, TAD-YATHĂ:
OM VATTĀLI VADĀLI VARALI VARÄHÄ-MUKII SARVA-DUSTĀNĀM

mukhi, bind, bind the eyes and mouth of all the wicked and
corrupt, svdha!)
(196) Stop making the gesture. As I breathe in, Mārīcī enters
my left nostril and dissolves into my heart. I become the god-
dess Mārīci, golden-colored, graceful and lovely, her right hand
boon-granting, her left holding one branch from the trunk of an
asoka tree. She is just a little wrathful. Adorned with silks and
jewels, she abides in lalita on a cart drawn by four yellow pigs.

great devoted longing, recite the mantra, the first of each round
of 108 being OM AROLIK, and the rest just AROLIK, without the
Om. At the end, make strong request:

of the emanated messengers mentioned above. The element -ali of
three of their names, 'possessed of a sting', may allude to their

sitting cross-legged under the bodhi tree. His left hand holds at
the level of his navel a corner of his robe, the right makes the
gesture of giving refuge.

lie Mahādevēśvara and Umā. On this seat is black Rāhula,
thrown down upside-down, holding an arrow and a bow, on
whom from HRĪHI comes a red uitpala marked with HRIH. From
this light-rays like hooks and nooses spread, make offering
to the Aryas, establish all sentient beings in the state of the
Venerable Lady, return and dissolve into the HRĪH. It transforms
into myself, Venerable Kurukulla, red, with one face and four
arms. The first pair hold an arrow with a red-utpala head and a
bow of flowers, drawn to her ear; the other right hand holds a
summoning hook and the other left an utpala whose root forms
a noose. She has three eyes and full breasts and is like a sixteen-
year-old. Her tawny hair streams upward. She is crowned
with five dry skulls, has a long necklace of fifty fresh heads, is
adorned with the five bone ornaments, and wears a tiger-skin
loincloth and abides in ardha-paryanka dancing posture with left
leg extended amid red light-rays and a blazing mass of fire.

Begin with a sadhana of Sambara with consort. On a mandala of
red lead in front, draw in the center the mantra to be practiced,
as a circle. Set out red flowers, liquor and the five kinds of
offerings.
In an instant, I become the goddess Tinu, red, her right hand
brandishing a knife and her left holding at her heart a blood-
filled skull. She stands in ardha-paryanka dancing posture with
left leg extended upon a lotus and moon. She is wrathful and
amorous and has bone ornaments.
At her navel on a moon is HRĪH in the center, SA in the east,
HI in the south, KA in the west and LA in the north.
In the place of the mandala in front establish another mantra-
wheel, whose syllables are of the nature of deities. Mentally
summon mantra-syllables from the goddess's heart to dissolve
into them, and taking liquor and flowers with the thumb and
ring finger, asperge them.

From Om at my heart light-rays spread, perform the two bene-
fits, return and reabsorb, transforming it with the sound of the
mantra into the form of the goddess, Vajrayogini, red, with one
face, four arms and three eyes. She has a lion's face, with mane
hanging down, and is adorned with bone ornaments. Her first
right hand holds a knife, the second brandishes a sword, the
first left offers a blood-filled skull to her mouth and the second
holds a trident khatvānga. Upon stacked lotus, sun and moon,
dākinis of the five classes support a jewel seat fitted with human
corpses. She is on top of this, in ardha-poryarika with left leg
extended
In her heart are the syllables of the mantra, clockwise. Light-
rays spread from them, inserting in her mouth the life-channels
of sentient beings-those of the Desire Realm red, those of the
Realm of Form white, and those of the Formless Realm black.
As she drinks their heart-blood, obscurations are purified and
birth and death cut off from the root. Recite: OM DUKHAYE

Dākin'), red, with one face and four arms, abiding in dancing
posture upon a lotus. She combines the wrathful and amorous
sentiments. Her first right hand holds a knife, the other a
sword; the first left a blood-filled skull, the other a trident-
marked khatvānga. Naked and with hair loose, she has garlands
of heads and bone ornaments. Dakinis of the Four Families hold
up her seat in the four directions. She is subjugating gods, evil
spirits ('dre) and human beings.
At her heart is red Avalokita, holding a pearl rosary and a
lotus, on a moon seat. Visualizing at his heart the seed and
mantra string, recite: OM MANI-PADME HÜM, OM DHUMA-GHAYE
NAMA SWAHA, OM HA-RI-NI-SA RACA HRIYA.

212. Blue Vajra-vidāraņa (rDo-rje rnam-'joms mthin-ga)
Out of Emptiness, from PAM a lotus and from RAM a sun disk,
on which from HŪM comes a crossed vajra whose hub is marked
with HUM. Light-rays spread, and it becomes a vajra ground,
wall, net and canopy and a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis. In the
center of this vast guardian circle, on a lotus and sun-disk seat,
from a dark blue HUM comes a crossed vajra marked at its center
with a dark blue HÜM. From it light-rays spread, make offering
to the Aryas, benefit sentient beings, return and transform it
into myself, Lord Vajra-vidāraņa, dark blue, with one face and
two arms. His right hand brandishes a five-pointed vajra, his
left rests on his side a bell. With yellow, upward-streaming hair,
in pratyālīdha posture (left leg extended), and wearing a tiger-
skin and snake ornaments, he is in the middle of a blazing mass
of fire.
Instantaneously he emanates to the ten directions ten wrath-
ful deities of the same form as himself.
He is crowned with Vajrasattva.
Recite once the introduction to the Vajra-vidarani-nama-
dharani (P 406/Toh. 750):
Thus have I heard at one time. The Lord was resid-
ing in the vajra. By the power of the Buddha, Vajra-
pāni magically transformed his entire body into a va-
jra and concentrated in the Vajra Concentration. Then
Vajrapāni, by the power of the Buddha, the inspira-
tion of the Buddha, and the inspiration of all Bodhi-
sattvas, emerged from the wrathful vajra and pro-
claimed the essence of the vajra: It cannot be cut or
broken, it is true, hard, firm, and unimpeded and in-
vincible everywhere. It terrifies all sentient beings, it
banishes all sentient beings, it cuts all spells, it sup-
presses all spells, it overcomes all rites, it does away
with all the rites of others, it destroys all demons, it
liberates from all demons, it summons all spirits. It al-
lows one to perform all tantric rites, it accomplishes
what has not been accomplished and makes what has
been accomplished inexhaustible. It fulfils all desires
and protects all sentient beings, pacifies, increases,
paralyzes and crushes all sentient beings. This great
power of the secret mantra Vajrapāņi proclaimed by
the power of the Buddha.

214. Wrathful Vighnāntaka (Hindrance-slayer)
[from the Guhya-samāja] ([gSan-'dus-las byun-
ba'i Raj Khro-bo bgegs-mthar-byed)
According to the instructions of Buddhajñāna-pada:
Out of Emptiness, on a lotus and sun from HÜM comes a
vnjra marked with HÜM, which transforms into myself, Amrta-
kundalin (bDud-rtsi 'khyil-ba, 'Circle of Nectar'), (green or)
black, with three faces and six arms. His principal face is the
same as his body, the right white and the left red. The first
pair of arms embrace a consort similar to himself; the other
two right hands hold a black, open-ended vajra and a sword,
the other two left a jewel and a lotus. He is in pratyalīdha, his
bent right leg trampling Māra the Evil One and his wife, his
extended left leg Ganapati. He has three eyes, yellow hair, and
all the ornaments and apparel of a wrathful deity, such as a
tiger-skin loincloth. The blue nāga-king Ananta binds his hair,
red Takşaka is his earrings, many-colored Kulika his armlets,
yellow Sankhapāla his bracelets, white Padma his necklace,
green Karkotaka his sacred thread, nectar-colored Vasuki his
girdle, and white Mahāpadma his anklets. He abides amid a
blazing mass of fire of Gnosis produced from his body.
At eyes, ears, nose, tongue, brow and belly are KSIM JRIM
KHAM GAM SKAM SAM.
At his heart is a Gnosis-being similar to himself, and at his
heart the Concentration being HOM.
He is crowned with Aksobhya.
Focussing the mind on the spreading and returning of light-
rays from the Concentration-being, recite:

215. White Viśvamātp (sNa-tshogs yum dkar-mo)
At my heart, from PAM comes a lotus and from A a moon.
On top is a white PHRAIM, which with light-rays spreading
and returning becomes myself, Lady Visva-māts ('Universal
Mother'), white as the light of the moonstone, and tranquil and
amorous sentiment, with one face, two arms and three eyes.
Her right hand is boon-granting, her left holds at her heart with
thumb and ring finger the root of a white lotus, which unfolds
a hundred petals near her ear. Adorned with jewel ornaments
and white silk garments, she sits in vajra-paryanka, radiating
moon-light and crowned with Vajrasattva.
At her heart on a moon is PHRAIM, surrounded by the mantra
string. Light-rays spread from it, inviting all Buddhas in the
form of Viśvamāt. They dissolve into the seed and mantra
string in the heart, pacifying all the diseases and suffering of
myself and others and increasing all life and merits. Recite: OM

1. The offering mantra (R 1, 1023.1) and the recitation mantras establish
the Indian name of the deity as Ucuşma Mahā-krodha-raja. In Tg.
titles, etc., Ucuşma is regularly Sanskritized by editors to Licchusma,
which is a name of Agni. See Glossary.
In 224-5, Tār. also uses the alternative translation of Ucchusma,
Chol-ba.
Genoud & Inoue, Basgo: Plate 6, reproduces a wall-painting of
this deity, which the author's were unable to identify.

Out of Emptiness comes myself, wrathful king Ucchuşma (Khro-

and six arms. His first pair of hands at his heart join threatening
forefingers, the second pair hold a vnjra and a bell, and the last
pair a hook and a noose. In pratyālidha (right leg bent) he
tramples on the entire host of hindering demons (represented
by their leader, Ganesa). Complete with all the requisites of

Out of Emptiness my mind appears as a dark blue HUM. Its
light spreads and returns and it becomes the dakint Ucchusmā
(mKha'-'gro-ma rMe-brisegs), as black as charcoal, with the ap-
pearance of a wrathful female deity. She has three eyes; her two
hands hold at her heart a flask filled with purifying nectar. Her

hanging garment of black silk, she stands with feet together on
a lotus and sun.

227. Wrathful Sambara Burning on Touch (bDe-mchog khro-

Out of Emptiness, from three BHRUMS come three guardian
circles together, of tridents, vajras and wheels. Inside, on a
dharmôdaya, is a foundation of air, fire, water and earth and
a pavilion. (a) Inside this, amid the great charnel grounds is
ten-spoked wheel, on whose hub from HŪM and PAM come
a vajra and a trident, which transform into myself, the Lord
who Burns on Touch, black, his right hand holding on top of a
vajra an eight-spoked fire-wheel and his left a trident on whose
points is a four-spoked wind-wheel. His body is corpulent and
dwarfish and complete with the garb of a wrathful deity. He
has the eight charnel-ground requisites and the crown of his
head is adorned with a wheel and a crossed vajra. In alidha, his
extended right leg tramples Kälarātri and his bent left Bhairava.
(p) His consort embraces him, her right hand holding a knife
and her left a trident. Both are in the middle of a blazing mass
of fire.
He is crowned with Aksobhya.
From the union of the Father and Mother, drops of bodhicitta
spread to the wheel spokes, becoming wrathful deities in union
with mouths joined, including ones similar to myself and raven-
faced ones, beside the gates. Forms of the principal deity, Father
and Mother, go above and below.
Praise:
Touch-burning wrathful king, great in strength,
Whose body resembles blackest darkness,
Emitting PHAT amid blazing fire
Protector, to you homage and praise!

from PAM comes an eight-petaled lotus, on the center of which
from RAM comes a sun, on which from my mind as HÜM comes a
blazing vajra marked with HÜM, which transforms into myself,

third left holds Vāsuki as a noose, with threatening forefinger;
the fourth holds a khatvānga with Taksaka attached as a flag,
and a skull; the fifth a spear encircled by Mahāpadma. The
last pair of hands hold up Indra's skin as a scarf, with the right
holding Karkotaka and the left Sarkha-pāla. He abides in alidha
posture (right leg extended) upon Varuna and Varunī, beating
his five-colored vajra wings and complete with the ornaments
and apparel of a Heruka.
(p) The Mother Vajra-vārāhī, yellow and holding a knife and
skull, embraces him. They are in the middle of a blazing mass

of the nature of earth, yellow; his belly is of the nature of water,
white; his upper body of the nature of fire, red; his head of the
nature of air, black; his crown of the nature of Gnosis, blue;
and his wings of the nature of space, many-colored. His back
resting on five kinds of cloud, his right hand is giving refuge
while his left makes the threatening forefinger. Between his
two horns of thunderbolt iron the näga-king's stolen crowning
gem acts as an ornament. He abides amid a fierce, violent mass

Cf. the Garudas in 3001: 184-6, which combine features of
our 229–30, each devouring a nāga in snake form and trampling
one in half-human form.
1. According to Bte, the thirteen Golden Dharmas (gSer-chos beu-gsum)
comprise: the three Dakinis (our 77-79), the three major red deities

Red Jambhala (319), Simhamukhi (234/5) Black Manjusri (232)
2. The five poisons are anger, pride, attachment, envy and ignorance.
Each is related to one of the five Families and when purified by
Tantric practice is transformed into the relevant Gnosis or Wisdom-
knowledge-according to commentaries on the Hevaina-tantra, the
Dharmadhatu (Universal Law), Equality, Discriminating, Action-
accomplishing and Mirror-like Gnoses respectively.

spreading and returning, this becomes the King of Garudas.
RIJA PRIJA HUM! The Garuda-bird has golden wings and a vajra
beak. His body is of vajra nature, blazing with fire. His left
hand holds a precious gem, his right a three-headed näga. He

he is surrounded by an entourage of all the hosts of garudas.
Recite: OM VAJRAVATI-GARUDA VEGETA HUM HOM JA JA RIJA

and the left holding at his heart an utpala, which opens beside
his ear and has a book of the Perfection of Wisdom on it. His legs
are in vajra-paryanka. Just a little wrathful, and adorned with
silk, bones and jewels, he abides amid a blazing mass of fire.

bdellium (guggulu), and offer many tormas to the lords of the
soil. Visualizing the ordinary guardian circle, recite a hundred
thousand times: OM TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE RAKŞA RAKŞA SWÄHA.
Then for seven days strive in the meditation and recitation of
Vajrasattva's hundred-syllable mantra. Washing and purity are
very important throughout
The actual rite: on a square altar draw an eight-petaled lotus
and set on it three white flasks and a flask full
pure water
with medicines added. Adorn the mouths with branches of a
tree such as juniper...
Do the practice of White Tārā, with recitation. With the SWA-

Recite continuously even between the sessions, and with
particular intensity when on the point of sleep. For most aims
of yourself and others, and on such matters as your lifespan
or past and future lives, you should receive a prediction [in
dream) after seven days' practice. If not, your defilements are
powerful, so perform a washing rite and confession and practice
another week. It is well known it is impossible not to succeed if
after service of Tärä you practice for twenty-one days. During
the practice, besides the rules explained in the Action Tantras,
it is important not to meet human beings or dogs, not to eat
(strong-smelling vegetables such as] spring onions (sro-rnad),
and to abstain from extravagant foods and defiled foods.
Conferral: by transmission alone, no permission necessary.

heads move in the air above. On the crown of the central
snake's head is the Conqueror Akşobhya. Eight right hands
hold knives or swords, eight left serpent nooses, while the first
pair are together at his heart. His upper body is that of a rūksasa,
his back leaning on Mount Meru; his lower body is the tail of
a snake, coiled in the depths of the sea. All his mouths are
emitting ig-sa sounds. His hair-tresses, when shaken, give off
piles of noxious insects. He is adorned with the eight great
nāgas and eats every kind of naga as food. Trampling beneath
him a black candāla (outcaste), he abides amid a blazing mass

15. TRANSMISSIONS FROM SĀKYARAKSITA'
[Introduction)
Taranātha states that the sadhanas in this chapter: are described
in one place because although varied, differing in tantric class
and deity Family, their practice is consistent and they have the
same lineage.
He received them all from the Indian master Purnavajra, and
labels each one accordingly from the speech of Pandita Purna-
vajra'. All but two have the same lineage, going back to the
thirteenth century master Säkyarakṣita, and so are in most cases
further labeled 'instruction of Sakyarakṣita'. The exceptions are
258-9 and 260, which Pūrnavajra received in South India from
Deva-sambhava
237-45. The Seven Hero Buddhas (Sans-rgyas
dpa'-bo bdun)
Out of Emptiness, a palace, in the middle of which are nine
jewel, lotus and moon seats and on each a HUM, which trans-
forms into the following.
(237) In the center, myself, the Conqueror Sākyamuni, mak-
ing the gesture of explaining the Dharma.
(238) In the east, Buddha Vipaśyin, with the earth-touching
and meditation (gestures).

in meditation
(241) In the west, Buddha Krakucchanda, making the ges-
ture of concentration.
(242) In the south-west, Buddha Kanakamuni, explaining
the Dharma and in meditation,
(243) In the north-west, Buddha Kāśyapa, his right hand
boon-granting and his left holding the corner of his monk's
robe like the ear of a deer.
All these are golden in color, arrayed in the Marks and Signs,
and wear as garments the three robes of a monk. Each sits in
vajra-paryanka at the foot of his own particular bodhi tree.
(244) To the south is blue Mahākrodha ('Great Wrathful
One'), palms folded with a noose inserted between them and
a sword under his arm. He is complete with the dress of a
wrathful deity.
(245) To the north is green, peaceful Vajrapāni, his right hand
pressing a vajra to his heart, his left resting on his seat. He sits
in lalita, adorned with silks and jewels.
At the four gates visualize (E) Dhrtarăstra, (S) Virudhaka,
(W) Virupaksa and (N) Vaiśravana (see 35-38).
Praise: Homage and Offering to the Sixteen Elders (see 16-38),

knowledge-holders wielding weapons, and many of his own
emanations in various colors. Light from his eyes fills all space

Conferral: by recitation-transmission.
1. While the Tib. Nam-mkha'i shin-po ('Essence of Space') translates
both Kha-garbha and Akäsa-garbha, the seed syllable Kham and
the sources mentioned in the Glossary show that the Bodhisattva
among the Eight Close Sons is Kha-garbha. 3001: 150 gives his
mantra name as Khamgarbha.
2. Vipula, 'abundant, extensive', indicates conventional truths, the
many phenomena, while Dharma-dhātu is the Ultimate Truth of
their Emptiness of
of true existence--for which space is a metaphor.
Neither conventional nor Ultimate makes sense without the other,
so sambhava ('origin') could perhaps be translated here as both
'occasioning' and 'occasioned'.

beings merge to form a moon disk, while their minds combine
as a white lotus marked with a gem, and their speech as a IRITT
that marks its center. These send out light-rays, which invite all
the Buddhas in the form of Conqueror Amitabha, to dissolve

transform into myself, Lord Arya-avalokita, with eleven faces
and a thousand arms. His body is as white as an autumn moon,
his neck blue and his principal face white. Above this, in the
directions of the fontanelle (? 'Ishog-ma) and the backs of the ears
(rna-ltag), are six peaceful faces, blue, yellow, white, red, green
and vermilion. Above these are three wrathful faces, black,
dark red and pale blue. On the peak of the topknot of tresses
is the face of Buddha Amitabha, red and with the attributes of
a bralma-cărin. All eleven heads have necks. The first pair of
hands are at the heart, palms folded; right hands hold a rosary,
an arrow, a wheel, a sword and a trident; left a golden lotus, a
bow, a water-pot, a book and a khatvānga. The remaining 988
hands are boon-granting, with streams of nectar flowing from
their palms. In the palm of every hand is an eye. He is either
in vajra-paryarika or standing with feet together, adorned with
silks and jewel ornaments.

hand makes the gesture of a three-pointed flag, the second holds
a rosary, and the third, with a gem, is granting boons. The first

second a trident staff and the last a water-pot. He sits in the

272-4. The Lords of the Three Families among
the Eight Close Sons (Ne-sras brgyad-kyi nan-
tshan rigs-gsum mgon-po)
These three sādhanas, Comitted by Sākya-rakṣita,) are given to
complete the set [of eight Bodhisattvas each accompanied by
one of the ten wrathful deities (dasa-krodha)-begun in 247-
51]. It is not explained in [Tāranatha's) text how to give their
permissions, but in a permission ceremony it is all right to do
it by transmission alone.
What of extensive practice, if
But short practice wins the highest goals?
1. Täranātha's prefatory and concluding verses to each sadhana are
omitted in the Rin-lan, except for the few quoted in this Appendix.
272. Manjusri from the Eight Close Sons (Ne-ba'i sras

Of all the Conquerors' chief Sons,
The best of all is Manjusri.
Bowing devotedly, I shall write
His greatly marvelous sūdhana.
(a) At my heart on a lotus and moon is DHĪH, which with
light spreading and returning becomes myself, Arya-manjusri,
the color of young saffron, with both hands at his heart making
the gesture of explaining the Dharma, the left holding the stem
of an utpala that is marked with a book. He is in the lalita
posture, his head adorned with Aksobhya. He has five knots
of hair or a topknot of tresses and is adorned with silks and
jewels.
(b) Against his feet is wrathful Yamāntaka, dark blue, with
a garland of skulls, his right hand resting on Manjusri's foot
or raised in homage and his left holding a twenty-pointed
hammer. He is complete with the apparel of a wrathful deity.

By merely hearing and remembering the name of the Lord
of Great Compassion one attains the irreversible stage; with
devotion towards this supreme Arya that makes your body-
hairs stand on end and brings tears to your eyes, perform
prostrations, offerings, praises and circumambulations and
meditate on Bodhicitta.
(a) HRĪH at my heart with light spreading and returning
becomes the Lord of the World (Lokanatha), white as an autumn
moon On the surface of his topknot of tresses rests Lord
Amitabha. He either has both hands at his heart in the gesture
of explaining the Dharma, or his right hand is boon-granting
and his left resting on his seat and holding the stem of a white
lotus. A deer-skin over his left shoulder, he has silks and
jewel ornaments and abides in the lalita posture with right leg
extended.
(b) Next to him is the wrathful king Hayagrīva, red with
blazing splendor like the fire at the end of the eon, with a green,
neighing horse's head on top of his head. His right hand is
raised in homage and his left holds a white club.

returns and turns it into the supreme Arya, peaceful Vajrapāņi,
green, with a jewel crown, and crowned with the Five Families,
Akşobhya serving as chief. His right hand brandishes at his
heart a flaming vajra and his left rests on his seat. Adorned
with superb garments and all the ornaments, he abides in
lalita posture, smiling broadly, with a backrest of moonlight.
Alternatively, he can be blue in color.

On her two eyes is OM TĀRE SWĀHĀ, on her ears OM TUTTARE
SWĀHĀ, at her throat OM TU SWĀHĀ, at her heart OM RE SWĀHĀ
and on her crown OM TĂRENI SWĀHA.
She is crowned with Amoghasiddhi. Visualizing at her heart
on a moon, TĀM surrounded by the mantra, recite: OM TĀRE
TUTTĀRE TURE SWĀHĀ.
Praise: as 4.
Permission: permissions of Body, Speech and Mind; the sec-
ond consists of three transmissions (recitation, vow, inspira-

and eight arms. The first pair of hands, joined at her crown,
hold a vajra and a bell. The second pair hold an arrow and a

[276–99. General remarks)
It is also possible simply to use TĀM as the seed syllable for all
the twenty-one.
Where no posture is stated, it should be vajra-paryanka.
Although only recitation of the ten-syllable mantra has been
mentioned above, in the period of service and in the permission
or recitation-transmission, the Indian texts give mantras for
accomplishing the activities of each individual Tārā.
The permission rites for the twenty-one can be combined so
as to do them all in one day (two ways are described).
Deviation: 277, 288 and 292 break the above rule as to
posture.

[Front generation:] Out of Emptiness, from HOM E YAM RAM
VAM LAM SUM come a guardian circle, the four elements stacked,
and the four continents and Mount Meru. On top, from BHRUM
comes a palace built of jewels, square, with four gates and four
portals. Looking inside, its bounds are of crystal in the east,
vaidurya in the south, ruby in the west and gold from the Jambu
river in the north. It is beautifully canopied by long and short
beams raised up by 2500 pillars on each side. On the outside, it
has hanging festoons of pearls, tiles, pinnacles, parapets,' and
all the other ornaments; in the middle is the jeweled mansion,
three-storeyed. Underground are fifteen treasure chambers.
Outside, three rings surround it, with eight mansions on the
first in the cardinal and secondary points.
(a) Inside the central palace, from HRIH comes an eight-
petaled polylotus, on this from A a moon disk, on this from
SIM a white lion, and on this from a yellow Vai a banner,
marked with a wish-granting-gem jewel and with VAI. Light-
rays spread from it, make offering to the Aryas, eliminate
the suffering of poverty of all sentient beings, gather all the
abundance and perfect wealth of the universe, and dissolve
into the VAI, transforming it into the great king Vaiśramaņa
(Nal-bsos-po, 'Resting One'), the color of refined gold, with one
face and two arms. His right hand holds a banner marked with
a wish-granting-gem jewel, his left a treasure mongoose raining
wish-granting gems. He is sitting in the lalita posture on the
white lion, whose dexterous body is lying down while its eye is
directed at the mongoose. A rain of all one desires pours from
his mouth. With the splendor of a hundred thousand suns all
risen at once, he is adorned with all the jewel ornaments such as
a jeweled topknot and crown and wears fluttering garments of
assorted silks. From his right shoulder shines the sun, from his
left the moon. He is in command of the inexhaustible treasury
of space. Many powerful gods, nāgas and yaksas and ten million
[more] yakşas surround him.
In the eight mansions in the cardinal and secondary points
are: (b) E: from JAM, yellow Jambhala, holding a jewel. (c) S:
from PAM, yellow Purnabhadra (Gan-ba bzan-po), holding a full
jewel flask. (d) W: from MAM, white Maribhadra (Nor-bu bzan-
po), holding a gem. (e) N: from KEM, black Kubera, holding a
sword. () SE: from SAM, yellow Samjñāya (Yan-dag ses; in his
mantra: Samprajana), holding a sword. (g) SW: from GAM, black
Atavaka ('Brog-gnas; mantra: Gulyathana), holding a jewel red
spear. (h) NW: from PAM, pale yellow Pancika (INa-rtsen),
holding a storeyed building. (1) NE: from PAM, white Pici-
kundalin (Dzam-po 'khyil-ba), his right hand holding a saber
(gri) and his left a shield. Each of these holds in his left hand
a treasure mongoose, and is riding a horse of his own color.
They are adorned with silks and all kinds of jewel ornaments,
heroic and shining, with repulsive garb, and each with his own
entourage."
In the second ring are the eight great någas and their atten-
dants. In the outer ring are the hosts of the eight tribes of gods
and spirits. They are of various colors, repulsive, shining and
raging and holding all kinds of weapons. On the inner part of
this outer ring are the twenty-eight generals, all dark red and
holding swords and shields, and on the outer part the thirty-
two strong ones (mahabala), all dark green, with armor, and
holding spears and swords, each with his innumerable host.
Each one holds in his left hand a treasure mongoose, raining
siddhis on the practitioner.
Burn incense. From HÜM at my heart, light-rays spread. At
the tip of each ray appears a wrathful Takkirāja, holding a hook
and a noose. King and your attendants, VAJRA SAMĀJAH! (Vai-
Śravana is invoked this way in all the sādhanas 300-313, except
312.)

subjugate the three realms, and dissolve back, transforming
it into the great king Vaisravana (rNam-thos-sras), red, with one
face and two arms. He has bared fangs, two round, red eyes,

18. MAHĀKĀLA AS AN EMANATION OF GNOSIS
[340-48. Six-armed Gnosis Mahākāla (Ye-ses-kyi
mgon-po phyag-drug-pa)]
By their colors, the five correspond to the Five Families. After
the first, R numbers them mgon-bka' gñis-pa to mGon-bka' Ina-
pa, Second to Fifth Canonical Mahakalas. The principal deity
of 340-42 is certainly canonical, being described in Chapter 2 of
Sri-mahäkäla-tantra (P 344: vol. 7, 292.1.4-6; Toh. 667).
For the sadhanas of this chapter, cf. also ODT 38-52.
340-42. Black, Six-armed, Quick-acting Gnosis Mahäkāla,
Remover of All Obstacles (Myur-mdzad ye-ses-kyi mgon-
po phyag-drug-pa nag-po Bar-chad kun-sel)
Abiding in the practice of your Yidam, transform the offerings
according to Highest Yoga Tantra.
(v) Out of Emptiness, from a HŪM in front comes a guardian
circle, inside which, amid a great, unbearable charnel ground,
from PAM comes a lotus, from RAM a sun, and upon these a
white GAM, which melts into light and becomes Sri Ganapati,
white, elephant-headed and with three eyes. His right hand
offers to his mouth the essence of earth, a radish complete with
leaves; his left holds a skull full of nectar. He is adorned with
silks and jewels and lying down.
(a) Upon him, from a dark blue HÜM comes a knife marked
with HÜM. From it light-rays spread, annihilate all vicious,
hindering enemies, make offering to the Aryas, benefit sentient
beings, return, are absorbed and transform it into Six-armed,
Quick-acting Gnosis Mahākāla ("Great Black One'), fulfiller of
the hopes of living beings. He is dead black like the cloud at
the end of time, with one face and six arms, gazing angrily with
three round, red eyes. He has a gaping mouth with bared fangs
and rolled-up tongue, laughing loudly, and tawny, upward-
streaming beard, eyebrows and hair. He is anointed with dots
of red lead on the brow, and sealed with Aksobhya-raja on the
crown of his head. His first right hand holds a vajra knife, his
first left a skull full of blood, one above the other at his heart.
The second right holds a rosary of dry skulls and the last is
violently playing a damaru. The second left holds a trident spear
and the last a vajra noose. With his two feet, strong enough to
suppress the three realms, together, he is trampling hard on the
king of hindering demons (Ganapati). His tiger-skin loincloth
is tied with a girdle of green silk and he has a blue snake binding
his hair, earrings of red ones, armlets of multicolored ones, a
choker of a white one, bracelets of yellow ones, a necklace of
a green one, and anklets and belt of white ones. All his limbs
have strings of little bells on. He is corpulent, dwarfish, stout-
limbed and of infinite splendor, and is beautified with a crown
of five dry human heads with jewel finials, a long necklace of
fifty fresh ones dripping blood, and the six bone ornaments.
Giving a terrible, thunderous roar, he is destroying all demons
and obstructors and abides amid a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis
like the fire at the end of the eon, with his back resting on the
trunk of a sandalwood tree.
(p) On his left, amid a turbulent sea of blood and fat,
from BHYAUH comes Sri-devi (dPal-Idan lha-mo, 'the Glorious
Goddess') Lady of the Desire Realm ('Dod-pa khams-kyi dban-
phyug-ma, Kamadhätv-īśvarē), black. Her right hand brandishes
a demon's black, scored, magic stick (khram-sin) and her left
holds a bag of diseases. She is in the middle of a gale of fire,
riding a three-legged small mule and surrounded by a hundred
thousand pisaca, mätrkā and dakini attendants.
(b) In front of the principal, from HÜM comes the yakşa
Ksetrapāla ('Field-protector'), dark blue, his gaping mouth with
bared fangs calling lamentation on enemies. From his nose rises
a wind of the end of time. His right hand brandishes skyward
a knife, frightening all the gods and asuras; his left presents to
the mouth of the principal a skull of blood and the hearts of
hindering foes. He is riding a frantic, black bear.
(c) On the right, from BHYO comes Lord Jinamitra ('Con-
queror's Friend'), dark red, his right hand playing a damaru
and his left holding a blood-filled skull.



Rinjung Gyatsa

(d) Behind, from JAĦ comes the yama Takkirāja, dark red,
his right hand flinging a noose at an enemy, his left threatening
the vicious with a raised forefinger.
(e) On the left, from DU comes Traksad (Trakšad), great lord
of demons (māras) (bDud-mgon chen-po), black, his right hand
piercing the heart of an enemy with his trident, red-spear
ensign, his left holding a blood-filled skull. His upper teeth
press on his lower lip. He is wearing a flowing cloak of black
silk, high boots of shagreen, and a golden girdle, and riding a
black demon-horse with white fetlocks.
All four are complete with the garb of wrathful emissaries
[of Yama) (khro-bo las-mkhan).
Outside them are the ten directional guardians-E: Sakra,
SE: Agni, S: Yama, SW: Raksasa, W: Varuna, NW: Vāyu, N:
Yaksa, NE: Bhūta, above: Brahmă, and below: Parthiva-and
in addition, the eight great gods, the eight great någas, the
eight great planets, the nine great terrifiers, the twenty-eight
lunar constellations and the four great kings. These seventy-
five lords of the pure clans are each surrounded by a host of ten
million attendants.
Outside them are the armies of the ocean of pledged protec-
tors, delighting in flesh, reveling in blood, merciless, open-
mouthed, red-eyed, wielding all kinds of vicious weapons,
sucking out the life-breath of all living beings in an instant
They are dressed as yaksas, raksasas, yāmas, märas and matrkās
and fill the whole expanse of the earth, the air and the heavens.
All are carrying out the wishes of the practitioner.
On the brow of each is a white OM, on the throat a red Ah, at
the heart a blue HÜM.
From HÜM at my heart spread light-rays, inviting from the
foot of a sandalwood tree in the great charnel ground of Sitavana
in the south-east Six-armed, Quick-acting Gnosis Mahākāla,
above him my root and lineage gurus, to his right the strong
heroes, to his left the smiling heroines, and the servants, field-
protectors, messengers and armies of the ocean of pledged
protectors. With a burst of rattling, crashing and ringing from
damaru, bell and so forth they come in an instant.
Praise:
Though you stir not from Dharma-dhātu,
In wrathful form to subdue the vicious
You vanquish enemies of the Doctrine,
Mahäkāla: homage and praise!
Recitation: (a) From the HÜM at my heart come black mantra-
garlands emitting red light-rays, like the beads of a rosary,
strung on a string of five-colored light-rays. They emerge from
my mouth, enter Mahākāla's mouth, absorb into the HÜM in
his heart, reappear from the HŪM, emerge from his navel, enter
my navel and dissolve into the HŰm in my heart. Visualizing
a perpetual circulation like this, recite the heart mantra: OM
VAJRA-MAHTĀKĀLA KSIM KSETRA-VIGHNAN VINAYAKA HÜM HOM
PIIAT PHAT SWĀHA. (Om Vajra Great Black One, ksim, field
obstacles remover hūm... suāhā!)
For setting Ispirits etc.) on, attacking or killing, use the
fierce mantra (known as the Sasana dharani): OM SRI-MAHĀKĀLA

343. 2nd Canonical Mahākāla: White Mahākāla of the
Wish-granting Gem (Gon-bka' gñis-pa/ mgon-dkar yid-
bzin nor-bu)
This practice can be done with self-generation as a Yidam,
but will be described with self-generation and front generation
inseparable.
Out of Emptiness, from HÜM comes a guardian circle, in the
center of which from PAM comes a lotus and from RAM a sun.
Upon this, from GAM come two white Ganapatis, elephant-faced
and holding a radish and a mongoose, thrown down upside
down. Upon them are white and red drops of the true nature
of my mind, the size of a lentil, with in the center a HÜM the
color of quicksilver, from which light-rays spread, eliminate the
suffering of poverty of all sentient beings, return, absorb and
transform them into the form of Quick-acting Gnosis Mahā-
kāla of the Wish-granting Mighty King of Gems, self and front
generations inseparable. He is white and splendid, his face
wrathful but of smiling aspect and loudly laughing, with three
eyes and pale yellow, upward-streaming beard, eyebrows and
hair. He is anointed with dots of red lead on the brow, and
sealed with Aksobhya-rāja on the crown of his head. His first
right hand brandishes skyward a knife, the second presses to
his heart the mighty king of gems, and the last plays a damaru
of khadira wood. The first left rests on his left thigh a skull full
of nectar in which is inserted a flask full of gems; the second
holds a trident and the last a noose. His legs in hesitant walking
posture (? 'gro-tshom-gyi stabs), he abides on the lotus, sun and
Ganapati seat, wearing fluttering garments of assorted silks, a
tiger-skin loincloth and an elephant-skin scarf. With a crown
of five dry skulls and a long necklace of fifty fresh ones, he is
beautified with all kinds of jewel ornaments, sounding cymbals
and flower garlands (chun-'phyan). Surrounded by a host of a
million million subjugating dakinis, he is in the middle of a
blazing mass of fire.
At his heart is a red subjugating däkini holding a hook and a
blood-filled skull, at her heart the drops of true nature, and in
the middle of them a white HÜM.
Abode: the great charnel ground of Sitavana in the south-
east.
Praise:
Compassionate Lord of the Wish-fulfilling Gem,
White as a snowy mountain, giving out light,
Quelling all poverty of migrating beings,
Granting all wished-for siddhis-homage and praise!
Visualizing the mantra surrounding the drops in the heart,
recite: OM GURU-MAHÄKÄLA HA-RI-NI-SA SIDDIT JAH.
Conferral: again identified by the request and internal head-
ings as a permission. Includes permissions of Body, equiva-
lent to the Flask Empowerment, Speech (Secret Empowerment),
Mind (Wisdom-knowledge Empowerment), Qualities (Fourth
Empowerment) and Activities ('follow-up to empowerment'
(dban-gi mtha'-brten); it involves summoning wealth via a rain
of wish-granting gems emitted by the Ganapatis). Torma com-
mands follow, including a list of lineage gurus.
The lineage: Vajradhara, Savari (9th century), Maitri-pāda
(11th century, a teacher of Ky'ungpo Neljor); and again
Vajradhara, Ataya-vajra (= Atulya-vajra?), Rāhulaſgupta),
the learned and accomplished Ky'ungpo (Neljor) (mKhas-grub
Khyun-po; founder of the Shangpa Kagyü tradition). Then Mok-
chokpa (rMog-Icog-pa), Zhang-gom Ch'ö-seng (Zan-sgom chos-
sen), Kyergangpa (sKyer-sgan-pa), Nyentön the Great (gNan-ston
chen-po, i.e. Sang-gye Nyentön ch'ökyi sherap), Sang-gye Tön-
pa (Sans-rgyas ston-pa), and K'edrup Shangtön Rinch'en Bum
(mKhas-grub Sans-ston rin-chen 'bum, 1234-1309) (all mentioned
as disciples or spiritual descendants of Ky'ungpo Neljor, BA
733-748). Through another eight lamas, the lineage reaches
Jetsün Taranātha (1575-1634). For the subsequent lineage, see
Glossary: Rinjung Gyatsa.
Deviation: the Ganapati under the right foot seems to be
holding a bowl of something in his left hand, rather than a
mongoose.
Cf. 3001: 229, similar but with a hook in place of the noose.
1. Tär. omits the initial Om.
2. Maitri-pada gave this practice directly to Ky'ungpo Neljor, on the
latter's request for 'an effective sõdhana which would enable him to
gather wealth' (BA 730). The recurrence of Vajradhara indicates a
second branch of the lineage, also descending to Ky'ungpo.
3. Another 11th-century teacher of Ky'ungpo Neljor (BA 325,729).
344. 3rd Canonical Mahākāla: Three-faced, Six-armed,
[Wealth-guarding, Intelligence-increasing] Yellow Mahā-
kāla (mGon-bka' gsum-pa/ Gon-ser (nor-bsrun blo-phelk)
Žal-gsum phyag-drug-pa)!
Tär: Intelligence-increasing Yellow Mahäkāla.
Out of Emptiness, from HÜM comes a guardian circle, and in its
center, on a lotus and sun, male and female Ganapatis thrown
down. (a) Upon them is a yellow HÖM, which transforms into
myself, glorious Gnosis Mahākāla, yellow with a tinge of red,
with three faces and six arms, the principal face yellow, the

the third a noose. His legs in pratyalidha (right bent) trample on
the male and female Ganapatis. His body is complete with the
eight charnel-ground requisites.

colored and holding a knife and a skull, embraces him. Both
are in the middle of a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis.

He is crowned with Aksobhya.
Recite: GURU-MAHĀKĀLA KSIM USNISAYA YAKŞA HUM, RATNA

Praise:
Performer of rites of calming and increase,
Turning back enemies and protecting,
Expanding life and intelligence: Guru
Mahäkāla, I bow to you!
Permission: includes the four empowerments, and com-
mands.
1. Nor-brun= Dhana-raksaka; blo-phel = Prajña-vardhana.
2. R; X, Tär. gri.
345. 4th Canonical Mahākāla: Red Mahākāla, Mighty King
(Gon-bka' bzi-pa/ Gon-dmar dbar-gi rgyal-po)
Out of Emptiness, from E a blue dharmôdaya; in its center are
stacked a red lotus, a sun and the king of hindering demons
(Ganapati) thrown down upside down. On top, from HUM
comes a vajra knife marked with HUM, from which light-rays
spread, return and transform it into myself in the form of Red
Mahäkāla, Mighty King, ruby-red, with one face and six arms.
His first pair of arms hold a knife and a skull and embrace his
consort; the second pair hold a damaru and a trident, the last a
hook and a noose.
Three-eyed, with yellow, upward-streaming
Hair, a crown of five dry skulls
And long necklace of fifty fresh;
Loose tiger-skin; in pratyālīdha;

Great Mother Padma-dākini,
In passionate mood, is red and naked.

With knife and skull, she embraces the Father.
Both are amid a mass of fire.
In front of them is a black Mahakāla holding a knife and a
skull; to the right, Ksetrapāla, red, with damaru and threatening
forefinger; behind, Jinamitra, black, with knife and skull; and
to the left, Takkirāja, yellow, with trident and threatening
forefinger. They are surrounded by the whole host of the ocean
of pledged protectors.
At the principal's heart is a vajra marked with HOM, and at
the Mother's heart a knife marked with Am.
Abode: as 343.
Both Father and Mother are crowned with Amitabha; their
attendants with the principal.
Visualizing the mantra string at the heart, recite: OM VAJRA-

346-8. 5th Canonical Mahākāla: Green Mahäkāla, Master
of Long Life (mGon-bka' Ina-pa/ mGon-ljan tshe-bdag)
(a) Out of Emptiness, in the places of myself and in front, from
HŪM comes a guardian circle, and in its center, surrounded by
the eight great charnel grounds, a palatial mansion complete
with all the characteristics. In the middle of this, at the foot of
a sandalwood tree, from E comes a green dharmôdaya, in whose
center from PAM comes a lotus and on its center a sun and the
king of hindering demons. On this seat, from my mind as
HÜM comes a knife marked with HÜM, which transforms into
myself, Quick-acting Gnosis Mahākäla, green, with one face
and six arms. His first pair of arms, holding a knife and a
skull, embrace his consort; the second pair hold a damaru and a
trident, the last a rosary and a noose. He has three eyes, bared

någas, fire, water and stapas. They are seething with hosts
of corpses, vetalas and spirits (bhūta). Various birds and beasts
of prey roam around. Siddhas, vidyādharas, heroes and yoginis
are practicing in their pledges and adorn (the places with all
the offerings. Yakşas, räksasas, piśācis and hosts of servants and
messengers are acting amazingly with all kinds of behavior.
In the middle is a square, four-gated palace complete with
all the characteristics, scattered inside and out with heavenly
flowers and flowers of flesh and blood such as severed heads.
In the middle of this, surrounded by a garland of skulls, are a
red triangle and a blue triangle together. In the center of the
six points, on a lotus and sun seat is the corpse of a 'liberated'
hindering enemy. In the four gates are sun and corpse seats,
in the four corners moons; on the three points of the upper
dharmódayn are corpse seats and on the lower the relevant
vehicles.
(a) On the central seat, on a moon and sun in contact is a blue
HŪM, becoming a knife and blood-filled skull marked with HŪM.
From this light-rays spread, annihilate all vicious, hindering
enemies, make offering to the Aryas, benefit sentient beings
with the four activities, return and transform it into Sri-maha-
kāla, black as the cloud at the end of time, with the splendor of a
thousand suns, with one face and four arms. His three eyes, red
as bandhuka flowers, move around. His beard, eyebrows and
hair are tawny and stream upwards. His first right hand holds
a knife, the first left a blood-filled skull, one above the other at
his heart. The other right hand holds a blazing sword and the
other left a vajra-marked trident, with a snake. His lower body
is wrapped in a fresh tiger-skin. He is crowned with five dry
human heads with black vajra finials, has a long necklace of half
a hundred blood-dripping heads, and is adorned with the six
bone ornaments and snakes. Roaring a loud laughter of HAHA,
HOM HÜM and KILI-KILI, he abides in various lalita postures
such as sattva-paryanka. He has an unbearable räksasa's body,
corpulent, dwarfish and pot-bellied, very much agitated with
extremely wrathful compassion. Frowning in fury, he bares
frightful fangs. He possesses infinite expressions and changes,
such as great bravery, invincibility, pleasure, arrogance and
loud laughter. Amid a mass of fire as of the era of destruction,
enjoying all delights he terrifies even the frightful.
(p) In his lap, from HRIH comes Mahäkäli (Nag-mo chen-mo)
Pledge-queen (Dam-Ishig-gi dban-mo = *Samayendrāni), embra-
cing him. She is black, wrathful and amorous, naked, with
a crown and garland of dry skulls and loose, tawny hair.
Her right hand plays a damaru and her left holds a skull and

embraces the Father. In the fresh bloom of youth, she lacks
other ornaments.
The Father and Mother are sending out from their bodies
as messengers hosts of ravens, dogs, jackals, lions, birds and
black, outcaste women.
On the point of the upper dharmôdaya in front of the prin-
cipals, from CAM comes black Cămundi, holding a trident and
a blood-filled skull. On the right point, from HA, red Umā,
holding a knife and skull. On the left point, from HE, pale blue
Värähi (Phag-mo), holding a khatvanga and a human head.
On the front point of the lower dharmôdaya, from YA comes
black Yama, holding a sword and blood-filled skull and riding
a buffalo. On the right point, from RA, dark purple Rākşasa,
holding a knife and a skull full of human flesh and on a black
dog. On the left point, from BHE, Maheśvara, ash-white, holding
a damaru and trident and on a tiger.
In the four gates, HUMS turn into Hammer, Club, Lotus and
Sword Bhairavas, white, yellow, red and dark green, holding
their respective emblems in the right hand and nooses in the
left.
In the four corners, HRIHS become the goddesses yellow
Kula (Ku-le), red Kurukulla, blue *Kilayatr (Phur-'debs-ma) and
green "Hära-dharani (? 'Phrog-chan-ma), semi-peaceful and
affectionate in manner.
The (male) messengers are all in pratyälīdha posture (left leg
extended) and resemble the Father. The mätrkās are in alidha
posture and resemble the Mother.
The Father and Mother are sealed with the syllables of the
Armor Heroes and Heroines respectively (56-67).
The principal is crowned with Aksobhya and all the atten-
dants with the principal.
From HÜM at the Father's genitals comes a vajra marked
with VYA(M) at its center; from HRĪH at the Mother's a lotus
marked with DYĀM at the tips of its anthers. Appreciate the
great bliss of their union. OM VAJRA-AMBUJA-DWANDWA-SAMA-
YOGA-MAHĀ-SUKHA-PUJITE HŪM. (Om, Oshe worshipped with
the great bliss of the union of the pair, vajra and lotus, hum!)
Praise with the Eight-line Praise (P2644/Toh. 1778) or an-
other.
On sun and moon at the hearts of the Father and Mother
reside their respective emblems, a knife and a skull, with the
mantras and seed syllables at their centers. From my heart light-
rays spread and absorb into the seed and mantra at the Mother's
heart. Their light comes out by the genitals and activates the
seed and mantra in the Father's heart, whose light emerges

CI. 3001: 243.
1. A better name, given that all the forms 349-53 derive from
Nāgārjuna.
351. Four-armed Gnosis Mahākāla in the tradition of Ga
Lotsawa (Ye-ses mgon-po phyag-bzi-pa Gua-lo'i lugs)
Tār correctly includes under this title the variants 352 and 353
also. In distinction to these, he calls 351 the P'aktru tradition
(Phag-gru'i lugs).
Before me, amid the eight great charnel grounds (similar to
349), is a square palace of gleaming jewels with four gates
and four portals. In its center is a round palace of gleaming
skulls, roofed with skeletons and adorned inside and out with
all the ornaments related to the four activities, including jewels,
heavenly clothing, flowers, human skins, entrails, strings of
bones and fly-whisks of hair.
(a) In the center of this is a blazing, dark blue triangular area,
on which from PAM comes a lotus and from RAM a sun disk. A
blazing, dark blue HOM comes out of my heart and settles on
this seat. With light spreading and returning, it becomes a vajra
knife marked with HÔM. From this light-rays spread, annihilate
all vicious, hindering enemies and raise their state, return and
transform it into the glorious Gnosis Protector Mahakala, the
great hero, dark blue like the cloud at the end of time. He has
three angrily glaring, round, red eyes, gaping mouth, bared
fangs and rolled-up tongue, and is roaring loud laughter of
HAHA, HUM HÜM and PHAT PHAT. His yellow beard, eyebrows
and hair blaze like fire. Of his four hands, the first right holds
a vajra knife and the first left a blood-filled skull, one above
the other at his heart. The other right wields a blazing sword,
the other left brandishes a trident-marked khatvänga with silk
ribbons. He has a crown of five dry human heads and a long
necklace of fifty-one fresh ones, dripping blood, and is adorned
with jewel crown-finials, serpents of the four castes (cf. 172)
and all the bone ornaments. He has a tiger-skin loincloth and
sits in the heroic lalita posture on a seat fitted with a human
corpse amid a blazing mass of fire of Gnosis.
(b) From his heart three HUMS come out and settle on the
corners either side and in front of him, becoming three Karma-
mahäkālas (Las-kyi mgon-po), dark blue, in terrifying, wrath-
ful for dwarfish, their faces those of ravens, with vajra
thunderbolt-iron beaks, contracted in frowns and three-eyed.
Their right hands brandish knives, their left hold at the heart
skulls full of blood, which they are drawing into their mouths.
Their legs are in a stride-changing alīdha posture. They are
adorned with black, venomous snakes, and sending out from
their partings vajra garuda birds. They have tiger-skin loin-
(c) On the principal's right from KSA comes the Excellent
Black One (Legs-ldan nag-po = *Kalyana-kala, also called Legs-
Idan ben = *Kalyana-danda), his right hand holding a large,
sandalwood club (ben chen), his left a small, iron bowl (par-bu)
full of nectar. He has a flowing cloak of black silk, wears high
boots of shagreen on his feet, is in pratyalidha (left leg extended)
and has a golden girdle.
(d) On the principal's left, from BHYOì comes Candikä, red,
with one face and four arms, the two right holding a sword and a
blood-filled skull and the two left a human head and a bow and
arrow. She is naked, wrathful and amorous, is adorned with
bone ornaments, and abides in the pratyālidha posture (right leg
bent).
(e) In front of the principal, from HÜM comes a lion-faced,
black piſica, holding a sword and a blood-filled skull. He is
in dancing posture with left leg extended and is wrapped in a
black silk garment
Outside, in the gates and intermediate points, eight MA
letters transform into dakinis: E: vulture-faced;N: garuda-faced;
W: crow-faced; S: owl-faced; SE: pig-faced; SW: dog-faced; NW:
wolf-faced; NE: tiger-faced. All eight are naked, with one face
and two arms, holding a knife and a skull, and are in various
upright postures.
All these attendants have upward-streaming hair, three eyes,
and crowns and long necklaces of human heads. They abide
proudly on human corpse seats amid a blazing mass of fire.
Outside, a thousand black ones, a hundred thousand pisacas,
ten million mätrkās and all the hosts of the eight tribes of gods
and spirits surround them.
Light-rays from the HUM at my heart and from Mahäkäla's
heart invoke Mahākāla and his attendants from Akanistha,
the great charnel ground Sitavana, Nälanda, Sri-parvata and
elsewhere.
The principal is crowned with the Five Families, Aksobhya
chief; the attendants with the principal alone.

The lineage: After Nagarjuna, Aryade and Hayaghosa
(c. 800), the continuous succession begins with (Amoghavajra
of) Vajrasana (rDo-rje-gdan-pa, mid-11th-century). It reaches
Ga Lotsawa via Abhayākara-Igupta] (d. 1125) and Tsami (Isa-
mi (lo-tsa-ba Sars-rgyas grags-pal). From Gait descends for
over two centuries through P'akmo-trupa (l'Gro-mgon) Phag-
Imol gru-pal, 1110-70) and the abbots of the great Kagyü
monastery of Taklung: its founder Taklung T'angpa Trashi Pel
(IsTag-lun) than-pa (bkra-sis dpall, 1142-1210); Ratnanātha (1191-
1236); Sang-gye yar-j'ön (sTag-lun) Sans-rgyas yar-byon, 1203
72), Mangala-guru (1231-97); Sang-gye pelzang (Sars-rgyas
dpal-bzan, 1257-1310); Ratna-guru (1288–1339); and Ratnakara
(1300-61). Through eight more lamas, the lineage reaches Je-
tsün Taranatha; the same final eight as in other lineages follow.
Deviations: (b) only two-eyed; (d) blue and two-armed; (e)
knife instead of sword.
For this set as a 13-deity mandala, in which (b) appears once
only, see Ngor 128. For (d) as described but riding a mule, see

Front generation: as 351, except:
(a) The lotus of Mahākāla's seat is blue and eight-petaled;
his first right hand holds, instead of a knife, a heart-like 'be-ta
fruit.
(c) is absent. After generation of the three Karma-maha-
kalas (b), eight Hums come from the principal's heart. Three go
to the right of the three (b)s and become three lion-faced, black
piśācas (e). Three go to their left and become three Candikās (d).
On the principal's left is the goddess Remati, holding a sword
and a mongoose. In front of him is Ekajatī, dark red and four-
armed, her right hands holding a trident and a human heart,
her left a fresh head and an iron wolf (Icags-spyar) as if holding
a falcon.
The eight dakinis are on the eight petals, and are red in color.
Additional mantras:

Mantra of Ekajati: OM EKAJATIYE HŪM PHAT.
Mantra of the eight däkinis: OM SARVA-DAKINI HOM PHAT.
Permission: includes the four empowerments; forma, nectar,
vajra, emblems (or qualities) and activities empowerments; and
torma commands, incorporating a lineage list.
The lineage: compared with 351, some additional eighth-
century names, Indrabhūti and others, are included before
Nāgārjuna. The continuous historical lineage begins with Kala-
cakra-päda (Dus-khor-ba) and then joins the lineage of 351,
passing by way of Abhayā[kara) and Tsami to Ga Lotsawa.
Thereafter, however, the two lineages diverge until they both
reach Jetsün Taranātha. 352 was transmitted by Ga Lotsawa to
Zhang Ts'elpa Rinpoche (Zan 'Tshal-pa (Rin-po-che), 1123-93),
founder of the monastery of Ts'el, or Ts'el G'ungt'ang (Ishal
Gun-than), center of the Ts'elpa Kagyü tradition.

354. Red Mahākāla with Thighbone Trumpet
(mGon-dmar rkan-glin-can)
Out of Emptiness, from HÙM comes a crossed vajra, its hub
blue and its arms the colors of the directions. On its center is
a four-petaled lotus, on the center of this a blue dharmôdaya of
the nature of the drops, and inside this my mind as a sun disk,
which with light spreading and returning becomes a HÜM the
color of coral, which becomes Glorious Gnosis Mahākāla, red,
with one face and two arms. His two legs are either crouching
in the manner of a small child, or in lalita. He is adorned with
bones, jewels and snakes and has a tiger-skin loincloth. His left
hand holds a skull filled with the blood of the four Māras; his
right inserts in it a trumpet of a human leg bone).
The Mother, holding a sickle and a skull, embraces the Father.
Abodes: as 351.
He is crowned with Innate Sambara.
On the east petal of the lotus is red Ekajati, holding a trident,
a human heart, a fresh head and an iron wolf and riding an
ass with a red forehead mark. On the four arms of the vajra
are the raven-faced lords of four classes of spirits (Dud-mgon
= lord of demons (māra), bТsan-mgon, gNod-sbyin = Yaksa and
Gyin-mgon), all red, two-armed, sword-winged and kneeling.
Visualize: The object of practice is stuck head down inside
the thighbone trumpet. Light-rays from the mantra at my heart
enter his anus. Painfully, a stream of blood flows from his
nostrils, fills the skull and overflows. All the worlds are made
into nectar, offered to all Gurus, Yidams and Buddhas.
Recite forcefully: OM VAJRAKI KAWUWA-PUTRAM KILA-WAPA-

Make fervent request: Please guard the Buddha's Doctrine,
praise the majesty of the Jewels, and protect the Sangha's teach-

harms and injures sentient beings, or has hatred and ill will
towards us teachers, students and attendants, please subdue

emies by peaceful means. If peaceful means to subdue them

armed Gnosis Mahākāla (Ye-ses mGon-po phyag-

Self-generation: Yidam, or Gnosis Mahākāla.
(a) Out of Emptiness comes an ocean of blood, in its center
a Mount Meru of skeletons, and on top, on a blazing, dark red,
triangular area, a lotus and sun seat. On this, instantaneously
or from BHYAUH, appears the goddess Candikā, black, rather
thin and alert. Her two right hands hold a knife and a trident,
the two left a bow and arrow and the severed head of a hateful
enemy, from which she is licking the blood. She has three eyes
and loose hair and is adorned with a crown of dry skulls, a
long necklace of fresh heads with a string of hearts, and black
snakes. She abides in pratyālīdha (right leg bent) on a seat fitted
with a corpse.
(b) To her right and left are two black vetālas, naked, their
sexes standing erect, with clubs in their right hands and eating
the hands and feet of the object of practice with the left.

Self-generation: any very wrathful Yidam, or Gnosis Mahākäla.
Out of Emptiness, from HOM a guardian circle; inside it,
in front of me, a vast, triangular palace built of new and old
human corpses, fresh heads and dry skulls, pale blue skeletons,
and poisonous snakes. Its ceiling is of massed, dark clouds,
adorned with lightning and flames; unbearable thunder roars
and blazing thunderbolts fall like rain, mixed with a hail of fire
in the shape of vajras. On every side great cosmic fires swirl
and twist. The floor is a confusion of chunks of human flesh,
adorned with pools of human blood. This dreadful, terrifying
palace is a charnel ground full of carnivorous birds with fierce
beaks and claws and blood-drinking beasts of prey with cruel
teeth and claws.
In the middle, from PAM comes a dark blue lotus with three
petals. On its center is a dark blue HUM, from which light-rays
spread, annihilate all vicious, hindering enemies, return and
transform it into Sri-karma-mahākāla, dark blue, with terrible,
angry, wrathful form, of dwarfish aspect, with one face and
two arms, his limbs short and sturdy. His face is a raven's with
vajra thunderbolt-iron beak, frowning and three-eyed. His right
hand brandishes a vajra knife like blazing fire, his left holds at
his heart a skull full of blood, which he is drawing into his
mouth. His eyebrows, hair and beard blaze upwards. His
mouth gapes widely, its vapor a swirling gale of fire, dribbling
rivers of blood, baring sharp fangs and yelling a furious roar.
In stride-changing alidha posture, he is adorned with black,
poisonous snakes and has a crown of five dry skulls and a long
necklace of fifty fresh heads. From the parting of his hair he
is sending out vajra garuda birds. He has a tiger-skin loincloth.
With the splendor of a hundred thousand suns, he abides amid
a blazing mass of fire, subduing with his stamping feet the head
of a malevolent enemy.
He is surrounded by infinite attendants, including a thou-
sand black, raven-faced ones, a hundred thousand piśācas, the
eight tribes of gods and spirits, emanations in the image of his
head, secondary emanations as birds with beaks and claws,
hosts of dangerous beasts of prey, and in particular, vicious,
dark blue nägas holding razors and serpent nooses.
At the principal's heart, on a triangular sun, is a blue HŪM.

(a) Out of Emptiness, in space in front of me amid a great
charnel ground is a crushed hindering enemy, on whom from
PAM comes a lotus and from RAM a sun. On this is a dark
blue HUM, from which light-rays spread, annihilate all vicious,
hindering enemies, return and transform it into Vajra-mahā-
kāla (rDo-rje nag-po chen-po), the color of cosmic darkness, large
and brightly blazing, with one face and two arms, the right
hand holding a knife and the left a blood-filled skull one above
the other at his heart. Between both arms he bears a magic
wooden gong (gandi). He has three eyes, bared fangs and
yellow, upward-streaming hair, a crown of five dry human
heads and a long necklace of fifty fresh ones dripping blood, and
is adorned with the six bone ornaments and snakes. Wearing
a tiger-skin loincloth and a diadem and fluttering garments of
assorted silks, he abides in 'fleshy dwarf' (mi'u-thun gel-ba'i)
posture on a corpse.
He is sending out as emanated messengers a black bird to
his right, a black dog to his left, an iron wolf behind, a black
man in front and a garuda above. He has a crown of Aksobhya
and is in the midst of a brightly blazing mass of fire of Gnosis,
surrounded by a measureless host of attendants-emanated
agents and secondary emanations of the eight tribes.

(p) On his left, from TRAK comes Ekajati, blue, with one face
and two arms, both holding at her heart a flask full of nectar. She
is scarfed in a white silk garment and has a tiger-skin loincloth.
Her hair-tresses are in a single braid, hanging down on the left.
She is of wrathful female aspect.
(b) Inside her vast belly, from TRAK comes an ocean of blood,
in the center of which from BHYAUH comes Sri-devi Lady of the
Desire Realm, riding a white-nosed ass, dark blue, with one
face and four arms. Her first right hand holds a sword, the
second a blood-filled skull, the first left a spear, the second a
trident. She has a crown of five dry human heads and a long
necklace of fifty fresh ones, the six bone ornaments, a scarf of
elephant-hide, an ox-hide skirt and a hair petticoat, with a naga-
king girdle. She is three-eyed, bares her fangs and is putting
a stiff human corpse into her mouth. Her right ear is adorned
with a poisonous snake and her left with a lion. On her are the
spots of blood, smears of fat and dot of human ash. She is very
emaciated. From the direction of her navel shine the sun and
moon. Amid hundreds of thousands of mätykās, dākinis and
pisacas, she is yelling HŪM and BHYOH.
Mahakāla is invoked from the heart of Vairocana in Akanis-
tha, and Devi from the abode of true Nature.
Mantras: the ſāsana dharani (340 42), and OM RORU RORU
VITISTHA BATOSI KÄMALA RAKSASI HUM BHYAUH HÜM. The
heart mantra, OM ŚRI-MAHTĀKĀLAYA HÜM HÜM PHAT SWÄHA, is

1. This is the first verse of a praise I have seen ascribed to Nagarjuna
(see Willson 1985: 444–5). I am so far unable to find it among Nāgār-
juna's hymns in the Tg, but this verse opens a praise by Vararuci
(P2610/Toh. 1774).
From Mahākāla's heart comes forward a YA and from Devi's
a MAM. (c) The Ya becomes Black Yaksa (Nag-po gnod-sbyin), his
right hand brandishing a knife and his left with a sun shining
from its open palm. He wears a flayed human skin and has
golden earrings. (d) On his left, the MAM becomes Black Yaksi
(Nag-mo gnod-sbyin), her right hand with a golden razor, her
left with a moon shining from its open palm. She has black silk
garments and a coral ornament on the end of her braid of hair.
From their hearts emanate, from the Father's two Tris and
from the Mother's one BHYAUH, which become Putra and his
brother and sister (Pu-tra min-srin gsum) in front of them.
(e) From TRI, Black Putra (Pu-tra mag-po) with one face and
two arms, his right hand brandishing a long saber, his left
holding a skull full of warm blood and brains and offering
it to his mouth. He has a mon-kri sash (ga-za) and black silk
garments. (1) From TRI, Black Bhräty (Bha-tra nag-po), wearing
a silk sash and a tiger-skin coat, holding in his right hand a
dam-šin ('pledge-stick') and in his left a human heart, which he
is eating. (g) From the BUYAUH, Ekajata Räksasi (Srin-mo ral-
gcig-ma), her right hand holding a golden razor and her left
entrails, with blood dripping from her eyes and fire blazing
from her mouth.
All five are dark blue and dressed as children of the Mön
hill tribes, with the ornaments of human heads. Extremely
wrathful and raging with anger, they are haughty in the attitude
of annihilating all the vicious, amid a gale of fire.
They are surrounded by a hundred men with tiger-skin
accouterments leading the right wing, a hundred in the forms
of bhikṣus leading the left, a hundred black monks (bandhe --
ban-de) bearing daggers following just behind, a hundred black
women making a way in front, and in addition inconceivable
messengers such as black birds, black dogs and jackals, who
track down breakers of pledges.

and ornaments of snakes, bones and jewels, and wears a fresh
tiger-skin loincloth and human-skin and elephant-skin scarves.
His feet, in the form of a blazing ritual dagger, pierce the heart

Between myself and the front-generation, on a sun seat,

His right hand brandishes a flaming knife, enslaving Yama; his

and lungs of a hindering enemy. Behind is Planet-demon (Za'-
bdud = "Graha-māra), dark red and in the garb of a raksasa, his
head and body covered with eyes, drawing a bow and arrow. In
front is Guhya-dakini (gSan-ba'i mkha'-'gro-mo, 'Secret Dākini'),
dark red, holding a knife and a blood-filled skull. She has
three eyes and loose hair, is adorned with garlands of heads
and bones, and wears a human-skin and a tiger-skin. They are
surrounded by twenty-one dakinis, beings (srid-pa) of the male
and female lines, and the hosts of the eight tribes of gods and
spirits.
Light-rays from my heart invoke Mahākāla and his en-
tourage from Tamasā-vana (Mun-pa'i tshal, 'Dark Grove') char-
nel ground in the south-west.
Short praise:
HUM! Body diversely created from Dharma-dhätu;
Speech whose thousand-toned roar defeats the Māras;
Mind out of non-conception protecting great siddhas-
Great guardian of the Doctrine, to you I give praise.
Visualizing the mantra-string at the heart, recite: OM MAHĀ-

his chief disciple Dromtönpa Gyelwei Jung-ne (Brom-ston-pa]
rGyal-ba'i 'byun-gnas, 1005-64, founder of Reting monastery).
Then the Ka-dam geshe Potowa Rinch'en-sel (Rin-chen-gsal,

Self-generation: Yidam.
Front generation: (a) Out of Emptiness appears before me a
terrifying, great charnel ground. In the middle, from PAM comes
a lotus, from RAM a sun-disk and on this from NI the corpse of
a 'liberated' hindering enemy, stacked as a seat. On top, from
HÜM comes a knife marked with HŐM, which transforms into
Mahākāla, the color of the cloud at the end of time, with one
face and two arms, his right hand brandishing a knife, his left
holding at his heart a skull with a heart. Blood trickles from
the corner of his mouth. He has three eyes, bared fangs and
a vibrating tongue. His beard, eyebrows and hair are tawny
and stream upwards. He is corpulent and dwarfish, with stout
limbs and a huge belly, and has a tiger-skin loincloth, a crown
of five dry skulls and a long necklace of fifty fresh heads. He
stands upright in pratyalidha (right leg bent) on his lotus, sun
and human corpse seat amid intensely hot, blazing fire.
(Alternatively, instead of a tiger-skin loincloth he can be
wearing a flowing cloak of black silk, a gold belt and high boots
of shagreen.)
(b) To his left, on a disk of wind is BHYAUH, from which
comes Kāma-dhātvisvarī ('Lady of the Desire Realm'), blue,
holding a sword and a blood-filled skull. She is sitting in
btsan-demon-style (btsan-dkyil-gyis) on a raksasa's red-nosed ass,
running across a sea of blood.
(c) In front of and below the principal, on a lotus, sun and
human corpse seat, from PHAT comes Karma-mahākāla (Las-kyi
mgon-po), dark purple, with one face, two arms and three eyes.
His right hand holds a large sandalwood club, his left a small
iron bowl full of nectar. The club is flaming above, gushing
water below, and sending out from inside it armies of gods and
asuras. He wears a flowing cloak of black silk with a gold belt
and is in pratyalidha posture (left leg extended).
(d) On his left, from MAM comes Ma-gcig ('Sole Mother')
Ekajati, dark purple and holding a sword with scorpion hilt
and a blood-filled skull. She is riding a three-legged small
mule.
They are surrounded by hosts of directional guardians, field-
guardians, the eight tribes and spirits.
Short praise:

Young annihilator with terrible laugh!
Equal-minded, blazing with great anger!
Guard of the Sugata's teaching-praise to you!

corpse seat, he is adorned with a tiger-skin and snakes and has

Self-generation: Heruka etc.
(Front generation:) Out of Emptiness, from KHAM comes a
great vajra rock mountain, on which from HŪM and a knife
comes a guardian circle enclosing a great charnel ground. In
the middle, from BHRUM comes a palace, a triangular fortress
of skulls adorned with terrible ornaments such as pillars of leg
bones, hanging nets of entrails and roof moldings of skeletons.
Its single gate faces forwards. In the center, within a circumfer-
ential wall encircled by a garland of knives, is a thunderbolt-
iron wheel with a dark blue, triangular dharmodaya at its hub.
On the center of this on a lotus and sun lies the image of a hin-
dering enemy. On the spokes are sixteen lotus, sun and corpse
seats.
From HOM at my heart light-rays summon the consciousness
of hindering enemies in the aspect of green ŅI and yellow TRI,
which are absorbed. On the central seat, from HOM comes a
knife marked with HÜM, from which light-rays spread, annihi-
late all vicious hindering enemies, return and transform it into
Glorious Excellent Mahākāla (dPal Legs-Idan nag-po chen-po), in
the form of a vajra-raksasa, black as bees, dwarfish, corpulent
and with the splendor of a thousand suns. He has one face,
two arms and three eyes, bared fangs and rolled-up tongue.
Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth. His hair, beard
and eyebrows are dark brown and stand on end. His right
hand brandishes a blazing knife and his left holds at his heart
a skull filled with the blood of the vicious. He has a tiger-skin
loincloth, a crown of dry skulls and a long necklace of fresh
heads and is adorned with dangerous snakes. Fierce and an-
gry, he is so wrathful that he even cuts flesh from his own limbs.

Tār: Sadhana of Great Deity Brother-and-sister, called the Sub-

Self-generation: Yidam.
Out of Emptiness before me, the four elements and Mount
Meru; on the peak is a land of great charnel grounds, a very sav-
age place, a country of arrogant demons, giving off poisonous
fogs, where fierce lightning flashes, lethal thunder resounds
and a hail of thunderbolts and all kinds of weapons falls; a
place where the mätrkas gather, where fires blaze at night and
black winds rage by day, where fogs descend as pus, blood and
grease; strewn with all kinds of human corpses, dry, fresh or
broken, swept by waves of blood and fat, and echoing to the
howls of ferocious beasts of prey. Amid all this, on a foun-
dation of iron, is a great palace, its east side built of human
skulls, its south of horses' skulls, its west of monkeys' and
its north of sheep's. Outside, it is a jewel palace, inside, a
fortress of skulls, square, four-gated, blazing and extremely
terrible. Its four corners are of copper, its four gates of lac-
quered hide, their hairy parts brightened with gold, and with
bolts of magic lapis lazuli; the portals are of shell, the copper
and iron frosted with blood. Inside, it is roofed with columns
and beams of skeletons and marked with festoons of bones and
human-head finials. Cascades of blood pour down the walls.
The floor is strewn with the bodies of humans and horses, their
blood collecting in pools. Human and horse skins are spread
as curtains. From strong burning, smoke is given off to the ten
directions. Outside, on the pedestal of the foundation, vetalas
(risen corpses) do a dance and skeleton dancers leap about. On

Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
every side the palace has horrific, panic-inspiring ornaments
such as canopies of flayed human skins, human corpse banners
and flags, wreaths of moist intestines, garlands of every kind of
head, and fly-whisks of hair.
(a) In the center of the palace is raised a seven-storeyed,
black, hexagonal iron tower, with coppery blue turquoise steps.
In the middle, on a blazing, dark blue triangular area, a jewel
throne and a lotus and sun are a human corpse and a horse
corpse, upon which from RAM comes a poison-tree marked
with RAM. From this light-rays spread, annihilate all hindering
enemies, return and transform it into Gloriously-blazing Great
Deity Mahäkāla, Black Life-demon (Srog-bdud nag-po), skull-
garlanded and dark purple, riding a black demon-horse with
white fetlocks. He has two faces and four arms, the right face
a dog's, with crystal eyes, upturned and barking at hindering
enemies, summoning their souls. Both faces have bared fangs
and rolled-up tongues making a noise against the palate. They
emit laughter of HŪM PIAT and fierce growls. His two right
hands hold a poison-tree blazing with fire and a demon-noose,
the two left a scored magic stick and a skull filled with a heart
and blood. His three round, red eyes are staring angrily. His
beard, eyebrows and hair are dark brown and stream upwards.
He has a diadem of a black snake and black silk, is crowned with
five dry human heads and wears a long necklace of fifty fresh
ones, dripping blood. A bunch of a thousand venomous snakes
adorns him. He wears a three-layer, flowing cloak of black silk
with a dark swastika design and a gold belt, and on top of that
a tailored coat (bcad-slog) of bearskin with blue lion cuffs (? gon-
lag). On his feet he wears boots of shagreen. From his ears
a thousand thunders roll. From his nose rises a red wind of
kāla-kata poison. From his angry eyes streams fiery light. In
his mouth an ocean of blood and flesh collects. From his nine
apertures poison-rain-clouds descend on the degenerate (those
who have broken their pledges). The sun and moon adorn
the crown of his head. With his large body and massive limbs
he makes the three realms quake in terror, and in an instant
reduces to dust all hindering enemies and wrong views.
(b) On his left, BHYAUH and a sword melt into Sri-devī
Remati of Plagues (dPal-Idan lha mo gnan-gyi re-ma-ti), black,
with one face and four arms. Her face is turned to look
backwards. Eating a human corpse in her mouth, she bares her
fangs and has three eyes and tawny locks of hair twisted to the
left. Her two right hands hold a human corpse and a scorpion-
hilted sword, blazing with fire; her two left a mongoose bag
raining gems and a blood-filled skull. She has a crown of dry
skulls and a long necklace of fresh heads. A poisonous snake
and a lion adorn her right and left ears. Her mouth wails
fierce mantras, her eyes rain blood, her nose spreads a mist of
diseases. The sun shines straight out of her navel, the full moon
is on the crown of her head. A human skin forms her scarf and a
hair petticoat wraps her loins, with snakes of the four castes as a
girdle. Mighty chains clank on her feet. She rides a raksasas' ass
with a red nose and has five magic weapons: a bag of diseases,
a ball of thread, a bundle of red curses (byad-dmar), white and
black spotted dice, and a demon cross-stick (khram-bam). The
front part of the saddle is the upper jawbone of a raksasa, the
rear part the lower. A snake forms the crupper. She moves on
a sea of blood.
Both Father and Mother are amid a brightly blazing mass of
fire.
(c) In the six corners, from six BHYAUHS are instantaneously
generated six emanated messengers, the Black-dog Mön-
women (Mon-mo swan-nag-mo): Golden-eyed, Silver-eyed,
Copper-eyed, Bronze-eyed, Turquoise-eyed and Carnelian-
eyed (gSer-mig-ma, dNul-mig-ma, Zaris-mig-ma, 'Khar-mig-ma,
yYu-mig-ma and mChon-mig-ma). Each is dog-faced, with one
face and two arm | black, her right hand brandishing sky-
ward a vajra, her left throwing a black noose. They are naked,
with bone ornaments. Their locks of hair reach their heels.
Dancing, with changing gestures, and making dog noises, they
encircle Mount Meru. Wailing distinctly, they roam the charnel
ground
(d) The eight great yaksas of the north, transformed into eight
iron hawks, soar in front. They reduce to dust earlier enemies
already risen. The eight great yāmas of the south, transformed
into a tiger, a leopard, a tawny bear, a snow bear, a wild dog, a
lion, a jackal and a dog, follow behind, reducing to dust later
enemies who are still scheming.
Outside are three lion-headed male demons, emanations of
body, speech and mind; seven male and seven female Mön
tribespeople; other hosts of emanations and secondary ema-
nations; an army of twenty-one thousand maras, an army of a
hundred thousand gods, and the eight tribes, all naked, spread
out like birds on a plain, like with like. All are waiting on the
practitioner's orders.
When Avalokita's Mind's activities

triangular, blazing dharmôdayas as seat bases.
(a) On the central one, from PAM comes a lotus, from RAM
a sun, and on top, from HŐM a knife marked with HŪM. From
this light-rays spread, annihilate all vicious, hindering enemies,
return and transform it into Four-faced Vajra-mahākāla (rDo-
rje nag-po chen-po gdon-bzi-pa). His two main faces, stacked,
are black, and the right and left ones green and black. He has
four arms, the first pair of hands holding one above the other
at his heart a vajra-marked knife and a skull filled with the
blood of a hindering enemy, together with the heart. The other
right hand wields a blazing sword, the other left brandishes
a rosary of human bones. His brown hair streams upwards.
Three-eyed and gaping-mouthed, he bares sharp fangs and his
lower lips hang down. He is adorned with a sacred thread,
bones, snakes, and strings of bells. With a tiger-sk cloth,
he abides in standing pratyalidha posture (right leg bent) amid
a fiercely blazing fire of Gnosis.
In the four directions, from four HŐMs come: (b) on his right,
the Great Mother, black Dombini (yYun-mo); (c) on his left, the
worker (las-mdzad), green Candāli (g Tum-mo); (d) in front, dark
red Mahā-rākṣasī (Srin-mo chen-mo); (e) behind, dark yellow

holding a knife and a skull, extremely fierce and wrathful and
with the attributes of a female messenger, three-eyed, naked,
without ornaments, in a great hurry and facing the principal.
Encircling them round the outside are twenty-one demon-
slashing butchers, twenty-one thousand demon-subduing sol-
diers, and the proud beings of the eight tribes of gods and
spirits, with an entourage as numerous as the atoms of the
world.
Four-faced Vajra-mahākāla, Mighty Strength-sapping Field-

black skull-club marked with a vajra and his left making the
threatening forefinger, with a black noose. His hair is brown
and streams upward, his fangs are bared and he is naked, his
sex standing erect, extremely terrible in sentiment and without
ornaments. He abides in pratyälīdha posture (right leg bent)
amid a gale of fire on his buffalo seat.
(p) On his left, from CAM comes his consort, Cāmundi,
black, with tawny hair loose in individual strands and dangling
breasts. She is wearing an ox-hide and a black garment, holds
a trident and a skull and is very wrathful.
They are surrounded by Yavati (Ya-ba-li, 'Averter'?), holding
a club; Phywa-sans ('Free of luck'), holding a wheel; *Upa-

Karma-yama, red and very terrible, his right hand brandishing
a flaming sword and his left encircled by a blazing wind-wheel.
His mouth is agape, his tongue rolled up. He has three round,
red eyes and a yellow-brown, upward-swinging beard. With a
scarf of human skin, he abides on a buffalo seat in pratyalīdha
(left leg extended)
(p) On his left is his consort Ekajati, black, enveloped in hair-
tresses like darkness. She holds a hook and a blood-filled skull
and wears a human skin, her head bound with entrails.
The Father and Mother are surrounded with a hundred
thousand attendants each, yāmas and demonesses.
Out of their hearts come four Jas, becoming (b) in the east,
Rākṣasa Marutse (Srin-po ma-ru-rése), (c) in the south, Yama
Marutse, (d) in the west, Māra (bDud-po) Marutse and (c) in the

1. R'encircled by'; Tār. 'turning'.
2. Marutse (na-the-rtse) is the name of a charnel ground in the north-
cast, where the protector B'ektse (Beg-ise) resides (ODT 89-90).
According to Bte, it is also the name of a medicinal berry, called
in Skt gutlja (Abrus precatorius).
3. The Marutse charnel ground is infested with ferocious birds, includ-
ing hawks of lacquered leather, shell and iron (bse-khra, dur-khra,
Icags-khra), 'who screech horribly and who carry the brains of de-
stroyed enemies in their beaks', as well as ash-colored rakşasa-birds
(srin-bya) (ODT 90).
406. Blood-colored Red Karma-yama (Las-gśin
dmar-po khrag-mdog)
Self-generation: wrathful Manjuśrī.
(a) Out of my heart comes YA before me, which turns into
Karma-yama, dark red, greatly enraged and angry. His right
hand brandishes a five-pointed vajra and a human heart, his
left, with a noose, makes the threatening forefinger. With a
tiger-skin loincloth, he abides in pratyalidha (left leg extended).
(p) From MA emanated to his left comes Kālarātri, dark red,

Tār. adds: Hero
Self-generation: Sambara in union (Tār.: Sambara or Vajra-
yogini).
In space before me, from IIUM comes E, which gives out YAM,
becoming a disk of air; RAM, becoming an ocean of blood; sum,
becoming a flayed human skin; KEM, becoming a Mount Meru
of skeletons; RAM, becoming a sun disk, and sum, becoming a
skull-fortress palace. Inside this, PAM PADMA-MANDALA HUM
becomes a lotus seat, MA SURYA-MANDALA HOM a sun seat and
OM CANDRA-MANDALA HOM a moon seat. The seat becomes
two. On the two, from the seeds HOM and AM come a conch
and a cowrie shell marked with HŪM and AM, which turn into
the Hero Master of the Charnel Ground, Father and Mother,
white and radiant, with a very terrible skeleton form. Each
has one face, two arms, three staring eyes, a rolled-up tongue
and bared fangs, brandishes skyward with the right hand a
dry-skull club, holds at the heart with the left a skull full of
blood, offering it to the mouth, and abides in ardha-paryanka
dancing posture with the toes of the bent right leg pressed
against the thigh of the extended left. They have skirts of
assorted silks, and are adorned with jewel crowns and earrings.
The Father and Mother, abiding amid a blazing fire of Gnosis,
are both surrounded by a measureless entourage of worldly
and supermundane dakinīs.
Abode: the palace of the dākinis in Uddiyāna in the west.
Name in offering and invocation mantras: Śri-smasana-

to Jetsün Taranātha, and the usual eight follow.
Cf. 3001: 253. Phere substitutes the IWS icon.
1. LC's criticism of ODT 86 (erroneously placed with the next icon)
is only half true. This pair are in fact here called yab-yoon ('Father
and Mother'), though Icam-dral ('Brother-and-sister') in the title,
Although they are sometimes depicted embracing (e.g. Jamyang
1982: 263), the fact that 409 are also described as Bran-bdud yab-

invariably imply sexual union.

Self-generation: any Yidam.
Front generation: Out of Emptiness, a supermundane
mandala
(411) To the north, from VAI comes King Vaiśravana (rNam-
thos-sras), golden-colored, holding a club marked with a gem
and a treasure mongoose. He is corpulent and full of mirth.
Either side of him are treasure vases and rivers of jewels
flowing. He sits on a jewel throne and a lion.
(412) To the east, from DHRI comes the great king Dhrtarastra
(Yul-'khor-srutt), white with a greenish tint. He is playing a lute
(vind), with peaceful manner, and sits on a jewel throne and
elephant seat.
(413) To the south, from VI comes the great king Virudha-
ka ('Phags-skyes-po), sky-blue, holding a blazing sword. He is
slightly wrathful in sentiment and sits on a jewel throne and
buffalo seat.
(414) To the west, from KȘA comes the great king Virūpåkşa
(Mig-mi-bzan), red and smiling. His right hand holds a serpent
noose and his left a precious caitya, at which he is looking.
He has red eyes, blazing, yellow hair and a sevenfold hood of
snakes' heads, and sits on a jewel throne and näga seat.
All are adorned with silks and all the jewel ornaments. They
are brave and shining, their radiance hard to bear. Their eyes,
full of pleasure, are round and wide open. They wear jewel
armor and are complete with the attributes of a monarch, such
as a crown (ze'u-kha) with a wish-granting-gem tiara.
Abode: a terrace of Mount Meru.

club). Virūpåksa is said to be orange.
Recite their individual name mantras, OM VAISRAWANAYA
SWĀHĀ, etc., or OM VAI SWAHĀ, OM DHRI SWĀHA, OM VI SWĀHĀ,
OM KȘA SWĀHĀ. For pacifying, the mantras end with SWÄHA,
for increasing with NAMAH, for subjugating with WAȘAT and
for fierce rites with HŐM. To practice all four activities equally,
recite: OM VAI NAMAH VOSATA', OM DHRI SWAHĀ OM, OM VI
MĀRAYA HOM PHAT, OM KSA WASAT HOH.
Conferral: by command-transfer, including flask empower-

Self-generation: any Yidam of Secret Mantra.
In space before me, from HŪM come a guardian circle and
a dharmôdaya, the space element, in the middle of which is a
palace with a siddhi-generating charnel ground. In the center
are five lotus seats.
(a) On the middle one, on a moon is OM, from which comes
Buddha-dākini (Sans-rgyas mkha'-'gro-ma), white and crowned
with Vairocana. She is peaceful in sentiment.
(b) In the east, on a sun, from HÜM comes Vajra-dakini, blue,
crowned with Aksobhya, and wrathful in sentiment.
(c) In the south, on a yellow moon, from TRAM comes Ratna-
dākini, yellow, crowned with Ratna-sambhava, and cheerful in
sentiment.

Padma-dakini, red, crowned with Amitabha, and of the pas-
sionate sentiment.
(e) In the north, on a crossed vajra, from Aì comes Visva-
däkini, green, crowned with Amoghasiddhi, and of various
sentiments including wrath and mirth. (Note the caption and
recitation mantra call her Karma-dākini.)
Each plays a damaru with her right hand, while her left holds
at her heart a skull full of nectar. They have crowns of five dry
skulls, long necklaces of fifty fresh heads, and the five symbolic
ornaments of bone. Their hair is black and half bound up.
Under the left arm of each is a khatvānga, of the nature of Method

CONCLUSION
Closing Verses
1 Adorned on the crown with the precious gem of Union,
haloed with hoods of the Two Stages' oral instructions,
With the PHAT sound of the supreme, unchanging innate,
born of delight in his wife, the Dharma-dhātu,
He's banished the demon-host of dualistic illusion;
amidst his heart he has broken the egg of ignorance;
From the thick mass of clouds of his excellent teaching, he's skilled
in letting fall rain of supreme and ordinary siddhis.
2 From that resort of the host of wise, realized nāga-kings,
The great Lake Anavatapta of the tantric texts,
Flow into the sea of his mind great floods of inspiring power
Of the countless knowledge-transfers of peaceful and wrathful [deities]
3 In the beautiful sky of TĀRANATHA's excellent teachings
Now rises here the Expansion's sun,' which by caressing
With frolicsome beams of practice, seeing and hearing, bestows
The splendor of hundred-petaled blossoms of Conqueror's Doctrine.
4 But since accumulations of leaves of imperfections
And creepers of meaningless verbiage smother important points,
The Expansion, even though called a wish-fulfilling tree,
Is [more] like a lamp in a picture, with nothing it can illumine.

That such an Expansion of the method of giving permissions for the host of deities explained in the Mine
of Sadhanas was needed, was urged by my spiritual friends, proclaimers of scripture and knowledge, the

transmission (bklags-lun) and for which observation of the practice had been passed on, and be easy to
understand even for someone of inferior intellect like me. Those who wish to practice according to the
Dharma must definitely rely on the Yidam deities who grant realizations and the Dharma-protectors who
guard against hindrances. To accomplish desired goals in dependence upon their service-practice also
it is definitely necessary to obtain the empowerments and the knowledge-transfers or permissions and
transmissions of sādhanas that cause the Gnosis of the deities' minds to be born within one's own mental
continuum. Further, in view of the diverse dispositions of disciples, Vajradhara taught in the Tantras the
various sādhanas of Yidam deities, from which the Venerable Kün[ga] Nying po)* collected in one place
the lineages of most of the main and appended permissions. Seeing that these many and various sadhanas
were helpful to migrating beings, the Buddhist monk Lozang Pelden Tenpei Nyima Ch'ok-le nam-gyel

Part Two
The Narthang Gyatsa
The Narthang Gyatsa (sNar-than brgya-rtsa) or 'Hundred-odd
[sādhanas of] Narthangʻis a cycle of thirty-three sõdhanas, or deity
practices, compiled by Ch'im Namk'a-tra (mChims Nam-mkha'-
grags), abbot of Narthang monastery from 1251 to 1288. Ch'im's
text' in fact includes many other rites and instructions besides, but
these do not concern us here. Some of the sādhanas were written
down by Ch'im from oral instructions of his lamas and some were
translated Indian texts. The sadhanas are supposed to have been
introduced to Tibet from India by Atīša (982–1054). However, the
lineages given by Ch'im do not go back that far.
The TWS illustrations follow the very different order of the
Narthang Gyatsa practices as given by Kyisho zhapdr'ung tulku
Ngawang Tendzin Tr’inle (sKyid-sod śabs-drun sprul-sku Nag-dban
bstan-'dzin 'phrin-las). This great Gelukpa lama lived from 1639
to 1682 and was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-82) and
the First Panchen Rinpoche (c. 1570–1662). His collected works
have recently been reproduced from a manuscript of about the
eighteenth century from Ladakh. The relevant text, The Quick-
acting Grace, an addendum to the method of giving permissions for the
Narthang Gyatsa deities, is in Volume Two. The manuscript is in
dbu-med script, very neat but full of abbreviations.
This is the text translated below. For each deity it gives a very
brief sādhana, suitable for daily practice—so short, in fact, that it
has been possible to give them in full, apart from abbreviating
standard phrases after their first occurrence. Details such as
beginning by taking Refuge, generating Bodhicitta and purifying
into Emptiness are of course implicitly included in all the sadhanas
though not mentioned after the first few. We refer to this text as 'K
and give in a footnote to each sādhana the ordinal number of the
sādhana in the text (bold) and the page reference. When material
from Ch'im's text is introduced it will be distinguished either by
the label 'Ch' or by angle brackets (...).
Headings in tiny, barely decipherable script indicate K's prin-
ciple of arrangement. The deities are organized by the families
of the two lower classes of Tantras. First come those of the three
supermundane Families, in order of seniority-Tathāgata Fam-
ily, Lotus Family, Vajra Family--and in descending order of rank
within each. Then comes one of the worldly families, the Wealthy
Family, to which the wealth deities of chapter 17 of the Rinjung
Gyatsa belong. Prajñā-paramitā is labeled Sūtra, implying that as
a personification of the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras she falls out-
side this system. Finally, two deities of Highest Yoga Tantra are
appended.
L.S. Dagyab (1986) has published in German a tabulation of the
Narthang Gyatsa iconography based on a text by Zhuch'en Ts'ül-
tr'im rinch'en (zu-chen Tshul-khrims rin-chen, 1697-1769), of the
Sakya school. This deviates from K's Narthang Gyatsa tradition
in some respects, notably the order, which follows Ch'im. The
numbers D1 to D 33 refer to this book. Its descriptions are slightly
more detailed than ours, but only about seven main deities and
a few attendant ones differ significantly. These differences will
be noted at the end of each sādhana, following the listing of any
379

Deities of Tibetan Buddhism
inconsistencies between the painting and the text K.
In this section the illustrations depart markedly from the text
a number of times: six deities are completely the wrong color,
and there are several other significant errors, especially of color.
Ch'im's and Dagyab's texts show that not more than one or two of
these discrepancies can be attributed to errors in the manuscript of
K. It looks as if the artist lacked a text of the Narthang Gyatsa to refer
to and simply worked from the blockprint illustrations, making
plausible guesses at the colors based on general knowledge.
The manuscript of K frequently omits the visarga sign (h) in
mantras. When we write [h], the mantra in the blockprint (X)
includes the h and K omits it.

(2) The Great Sage with the Sixteen Elders (Thub-pa chen-
po-la gnas-brlan bcu-drug-gis bskor-ba)
First, take Refuge...
(a) Out of Emptiness, from BHRUM comes a mansion made
of jewels, square and with four gates. In its midst, on the
center of a sixteen-petaled lotus, is Lord Sākyamuni, the color
of refined gold, his right hand touching the earth and his left in
meditation, sitting in vajra-paryanku.
Not described are his two chief disciples standing beside
him, (b) Sariputra and (c) Maha-maudgalyāyana. Both are
dressed as monks and bear an almsbowl and a monk's staff.
On the four eastern petals of the lotus are: (d) Mahāsthavira
(Great Elder) Rahula (sGra-can-zin), holding in his right hand
a jewel crown; (e) Mahästhavira Cuda-panthaka (Lam-phran-
gtan), with both hands in meditation; (f) Mahāsthavira Pindola-
bharadvāja (Ba-ra-dhun-dza bSod-soms-len), holding in his right
hand a book and on the left, in meditation, an almsbowl; and
(g) Mahāsthavira Panthaka (Lam-gtan), a book in his right hand
and making the gesture of explaining the Dharma with his left.
On the four southern petals are: (h) Mahästhavira Nāga-
sena (kLu'i sde), his right hand holding a flask and his left a
monk's staff (khakkhara); (1) Mahāsthavira Gopaka (sBed-byed),
holding a book in his hands; (1) Mahāsthavira Abheda (Mi-
phyed-pa), holding between folded palms the Mahābodhi Stūpa;
and (k) Mahästhavira Angaja (Yan-lag-byun), holding between
folded palms a censer, and under his left arm a fly-whisk.
On the four western petals are: (1) Mahāsthavira Ajita (Ma-
pham-pa), with both hands in meditation; (m) Mahasthavira
Vanavāsin (Nags-na-gnas), his right hand with peaceful raised
forefinger (tarjanī) and his left holding a fly-whisk; (n) Maha-
sthavira Kālika (Dus-ldan), holding gold earrings in his hands;
and (0) Mahästhavira Vajrīputra (rDo-rje-mo'i bu), his right hand
with peaceful raised forefinger and his left holding a fly-whisk.
On the four northern petals are: (p) Mahāsthavira Bhadra
(bZan-po), his right hand explaining the Dharma and his left in
meditation; (9) Mahästhavira Kanaka-vatsa (gSer-be'u), holding
a precious noos in his hands; (r) Mahasthavira Kanaka-bhara-
dvāja (Ba-ra-dhun-dza gser-can), with both hands in meditation;
and (s) Mahasthavira Bakula (Ba-ku-la), holding in both hands a
mongoose.
At the four gates are the Four Great Kings (1) Dhrtarăstra,
(u) Virūdhaka, (v) Virupaksa and (w) Vaiśravana), and (x) the
great Arya upāsaka Dharmatrāta (Dharma-ta-la), holding in his
hands a fly-whisk and a flask. His locks of hair are tied in a
topknot and bear an original manuscript of scriptures. In the
space before him is Buddha Amitabha. He is wearing fluttering
silken garments, and is emanating from his right knee a host of
tigers. He sits with an assembly of upisakas.
In space in front are measureless hosts of Gurus, spiritual
friends, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Arhants.
Recite the invocation section (verses 2-11) of the Homage and
Offering to the Elders (HOE) (see 16-38).
OM ARGHAM PRATICCHA SWĀHĀ. JAH HUM VAM HOH, they
become non-dual. The crowns of the principal and entourage

of Cuļa-panthaka and Kanaka-bharadvāja, of Vanavāsin and
Vajriputra, and perhaps of Panthaka and Gopaka.

benefits and reabsorbs, transforming it myself, Usnisa-
vijayā ('Uşnişa Victorious Lady'), white, with three faces, white,

crossed vajra, a lotus on which is Buddha Amitābha, and an
arrow, and the boon-granting gesture; the left hold a noose,
with threatening forefinger, a bow, the gesture of protection
(abhaya-mudra) and a flask. Each face has three eyes. Adorned

Part Three
Principal deities of the Vajrâvalī trilogy
Sources
adds helpful details from other works, gives full descriptions of
mandalas Abhayākara mentioned only in passing, making forty-
two, and adds three new mandalas from a different source, the
Kriya-samuccaya ('Compendium of Rites'), to give a total of forty-
five. This is the presentation the IWS illustrations follow.
Each page of the third and final part of IWS carries the marginal
label Dor-phren, which stands for the Sanskrit Vajrávali. This
refers to a trilogy of texts by the prominent Indian teacher Abhayā-
kara-gupta (d. 1125), all three devoted to the same set of mandalas.
The first text, the Vajrávali (“Vajra Garland') itself, describes in
highly technical detail the procedures for constructing the mandala
abodes into which the deities are later to be inserted. It goes
through the construction step by step, dealing with all the mandalas
concurrently. The second text, Nispanna-yogávali ('The Garland of
Complete Yoga'), describes how the deities are added, mandala
by mandala. Both these texts are available in the original Sanskrit
as well as in Tibetan translation. The third text, Jyotir-manjari
(according to the Tibetan, "The Corn-ear of Light'), gives the rites
of burnt-offering, performed for example at the conclusion of a
retreat.
Each mandala contains from five to 634 deities, but it is only the
principal deity of each that is illustrated in IWS. Thus, though a
complete translation of Abhayākara-gupta's trilogy would fill a
substantial book, what concerns us here is just a fraction of the
Nispanna-yogávali.
Some six centuries after its composition, the Nispanna-yogávali
was rearranged in a form more straightforward for practice, by a
Mongolian lama, the first Changkya Qutuytu, Ngawang Lozang
Chöden (1642-1714). His text, The stages of practice of the rituals of
the Nispanna-yogávali and Vajrávali, set out so as to be easy to practice,
The Author
The Changkya Qutuytu gives the following account of Abhayā-
kara.
Abhayākara-gupta was born as the son of the king of Singala
in East India. In his youth he went to Magadha, was ordained
in the Sarvästivādin tradition, studied the sciences and the
ocean-like Sūtras and Tantras with the learned panditas of
Nālandā and Vikramaśīla, and became a pandita complete in
the five subjects. Attaining the state of learning, purity and
benevolence, he became like the crown jewel of all panditas.
King Rathika(?) of Vajrāsana offered him a fine place called
Indra-ule, where he built a monastery.
On the Sutra side, he wrote many texts such as Muni-
matâlankāra ('Ornament of the Sage's Thought', P5299/
Toh. 3903) and a commentary on the Perfection of Wisdom,
Marma-kaumudi ("Moonlight on the Essential Points', P5202/
Toh. 3805). On the tantric side, he studied Mantra under
the mahāsiddhas Lui-pāda, Dārika-päda, Vajraghantā-pada,
Jalandhari-päda, Śrī-anupama and others, and practiced it
secretly, not revealing the oral instructions.

they spread and flourished in India. Then by stages they
were transmitted to Tibet.
Then a woman called Candāli, of the cattle-slaughterers'
caste, came bringing liquor and red meat and said, 'Son,
drink and eat these and you will receive a great benefit! But
he thought, 'I am a bhikṣu, so it would not be proper,' and
threw her out. As soon as she had gone, he wondered if she
was a dākini, and asked if anyone had seen her, but though
he looked he could not find her. Looking at her footprints,
he saw many udumbara and other flowers springing up,
and realized she must have been a jñāna-dakini. Intensely
regretful, he made confession many times, and prayed hard.
[The next day) a young woman adorned with bones
came and said, 'If you had consumed the meat and liquor
yesterday, you would by now have attained supreme siddhi.
In throwing me out, you rejected it. However, since you
have generated regret, you may still attain it. Now purify
your obscurations, make confession, and write a lot on
the tantric oral instructions. In particular, you are to do
a full commentary on the Samputa; and so that disciples
may enter the gates of Mantra, write an extensive mandala
ritual, and rit of permission for the deity hosts of the four
classes of Tantra.' She gave him much advice, bestowed
empowerments and inspirations, and disappeared.
Then the ācārya developed strong Bodhicitta, and in accor-
dance with the dakini's prediction, wrote the Samputa-tikā-
āmnāya-manjari (P 2328/Toh. 1198) in 8 000 ślokas, the Buddha-
kapāla-tikā-abhaya-paddhati (P 2526/Toh. 1654) in 1600 Slokas,
the Sri-cakrasambarabhisamaya (P 2213/Toh. 1498), [and many
other works). ... In short, he is reputed to have written a
hundred thousand treatises explaining the instructions and
commenting on the intention of the Sūtras and Tantras.
Therefore the chief of the learned and accomplished, the
ārya translator Gendün Trashi, said:
Of royal birth, he trained in the Sūtras and Tantras,
Taught of the deities, ripened and freed self and
others.

The five dakas are forms of the Five Tathāgatas, Vajra-dāka
corresponding to Aksobhya (cf. 482-7). However, N also refers
to them as Hevajra, śāśvata, Vajra-surya, Padma-narteśvara
and Paramâśva respectively. The consorts of the other four
are Locană, Mamaki, Pāndara and Tara, but Vajra-dāka's is not
named except in her mantra.
In the corresponding Ngor mandalas (No. 110), the names
of the dākas vary again and the principal's consort is Māmaki,
Vajra-sūrya's being Ratna-tārā. Ngor 109 is similar but the
principal has both pairs of legs dancing,
Deviations: despite the texts' unqualified assertion of iden-
tity with Sixteen-armed Hevajra, several differences are visible.
(a) The supporting gods beneath the seat differ; they are now
correctly four in number, but still the wrong way up and not the
same colors as C gives. (b) The animals in the right-hand skulls
are different. (c) Unlike Hevajra, Vajra-dāka has no crossed
vajra on top of his hair.

down for him to drink. Her right hand brandishes aloft a vajra
and with threatening forefinger threatens all malicious beings
{of the ten directions). She has a great splendor of sunlike
radiance {like the fire at the time of destruction of the eon). She
is menstruating, her body hairs are erect all over (N only), {and
her calves clasp the Father tightly above his thighs). Laughing
a little (N only), {of the nature of Compassion,} she wears {a

crescent moon, the peak of his forehead is furnished with five
dry skulls and he has a crown of the five Buddhas. From his
neck hangs a string of fifty fresh human heads; he is arrayed
in the six symbolic ornaments and his loincloth, of tiger(dvipi)-
skins or elephant(dvipa)-skinNT:C, hangs down at the back.
Imbued with the nine dramatic sentiments, he is dancing in
ardha-paryanka.
(p) The mistress of this lord is Citrasenā (sNa-Ishogs sde-
ma), red in color, with one face, three-eyed and with fangs just
showing, and two arms. She is naked, her gleaming, tawny hair
loose and streaming upward, her head marked with five skulls.
Her right hand is brandishing a knife, in the act of striking,
her left arm holds a skull dripping blood for the Lord to drink
and embraces him round the neck. Her long necklace is of {fifty
dry} human heads.
The Lord is 'sealed' with Aksobhya and the rest of the five
Tathāgatas, Citrasenā with Maha-vairocana. The seed at the
Lord's heart, {on a sun,} is HŪM. The heart mantra and all-
purpose mantra is OM BUDDHA-KAPĀLINH “H HĨ HAI HÙM PHAT
Citrasena's mantra is given erroneously in C, Chap. 32,
as OM VIŚWA-SUKHA HŪM PHAT-a back-translation from a
misspelling of her Tibetan name as sNa-tshogs bde-ma, found
in both C and Ngor. Clearly it should be OM CITRASENĀ HŪM
PHAT.

in the Sri-kalacakra-tantra (dPal dus-kyi 'khor-lo'i
rgyud)
N: Sri-kalacakra.
Half [the great mansion) is the Speech Mandala, half of that the
Mind Mandala, half of that the Circle of Great Bliss, and half of
that the Lord's green lotus. On the central part of this, covering
a third of it, are stacked successively disks of moon, sun, Rahu
and Kälágni (the fire at the end of time), on which lie Ananga
(Kama, or Māra, god of love) and Rudra (or Maheśvara), on
their backs. (a) On their hearts Lord Kālacakra (Dus-kvi 'khor-
lo, 'Wheel of Time') is dancing, in {extremely playful} alidha
posture (right leg extended).
His body is black and he has three necks-the middle one
blue, the right red and the left white--and four faces, each
with eyes-the principal face black and terrible, with
bared fangs, the right red and passionate, the rear yellow and
abiding in samadhi, and the left white and tranquil. His topknot
of tresses is adorned with a gem, crescent moon and crossed
vajra, and he wears vajra gems, vajra earrings, vajra necklace,
vajra bracelets, vajra girdle, vajra anklets, vajra diadem and vajra
garlands, and a tiger-skin {lower} garment that hangs down.
He has six shoulders, the first pair blue, the second red and
the third white; twelve upper arms, the first two on either side
blue, the second two red and the third two white; and from the
elbows, twenty-four forearms, the first four on either side black,
the second four red and the third four white. Every hand has
five fingers, each of three joints, of which (on the outside the
thumb is yellow, the forefinger white, the middle finger red, the
ring finger black and the little finger green, while on the palm
side, the first set of five joints is black, the second red and the
third white; they are bright with rings.
In the black right hands are a vajra, a sword, a trident and
a knife; in the red, a fire-arrow, a vajra-hook, a damaru and a
hammer; and in the white, a wheel, a spear, a club and an
axe. In the black left hands are a vajra-bell, a shield, an open-
mouthed khatvanga and a blood-filled skull; in the red, a bow,
a noose, a precious gem and a white lotus; and in the white,
(a conch.) a mirror, a vajr chain and the {four-faced} head of
Brahmä, {adorned with lotuses).
His right leg is red and his left white. The right foot tramples
on the heart of Käma-deva, who is red, with one face and four
arms, holding an arrow of five flowers (five flower-arrows),
a bow, a noose and a hook. The left foot tramples on the heart
of Rudra, who is white, with one three-eyed face and four arms,
holding a trident, a damaru, a skull and a khatvanga. At Käma-
deva's side is the goddess Rati, and at Rudra's Gauri or Uma
both sad-facedly clasping the Lord's feet.
(p) The Lord's first pair of arms} embrace the Mother,}
Viśva-mātr (sNa-tshogs yum), who is standing in pratyālidha pos-
ture (left leg extended), in union with the Lord. She is golden-
colored, with four faces-going clockwise, yellow, white, blue
and red-each with three eyes; and eight arms. Her right hands
hold a knife, a hook, a damaru and a rosary of aksa seeds, her
left a Sakti dagger,a noose, a white lotus and a jewel. She is
{crowned with Vajrasattva and) adorned with the five symbolic
ornaments.
Kālacakra is 'sealed' with green-colored Aksobhya (subject
to variation). At his heart, {on a sun, is a Gnosis-being similar to
him; at his heart, on a sun, he is marked with the Concentration-
being, a blue) HÜM.

Ngor 22 is equivalent but has a much expanded assembly
of Bodhisattvas, making 1037 deities in all? Another expansion
is the Vajradhātu mandala that is one of the two great mandalas
of Japanese Tantric Buddhism (Shingon) (Jap.: Kongo-kai man-
dara). There it becomes an array of nine mandalas, with 1461
deities in all. In this case, the central Vairocana has one face and
two hands, in bodhyangi-mudrā, and his seed syllable is VAM.

{round,} red eyes and is loudly laughing. He has a tiara
marked with five skulls and a crown of the Five Tathāgatas
and his tawny hair is bound upwards. He wears a small,NS
incompletens blue garment. One right hand brandishes a
terrible, blue vajra; one left, with threatening forefinger, holds
a noose; and the other two hands make the Spirit-subduing
gesture (bhula-damara-mudra), described as:
Twisting round the ring fingers,
One contracts the forefingers,
While the middle and little fingers
Are held fast by the chief, the thumb.2
He is adorned with the eight serpent-kings: blue Karkotaka
acts as his diadem, red Takşaka as his throat-ornament, yellow
Nanda and Upananda, counted as one, are his earrings, white
Ananta is his sacred thread, white Vāsuki his belt, dove-colored
Kulika the armlets on his gesturing arms, white Sankhapāla the

1. This is not the shorter of the two Vasudhara kalpas in the Kg, P342/
Toh. 664, nor indeed is it the other, P343. The name may refer to
the immediate source, the Rite for Reciting the Vasudhārā-dharani

2. C 43: 20.2.1.
2. C44: 20.5.3.
3. The disasters are shown as four in the than-ka reproduced by Rhie &
Thurman. 'All the planets' is there interpreted as eight, and there
are twenty-eight nakşatras. This brings the total number of deities
in the mandala to 1 + 8 + 4 + (8 + 28 + 4 + 1) + 4 = 58, but if the
eight planets appearing twice are counted only once there are just
50 different deities.
506. Thirty-three-deity Lady Usnīsa-vijayā
(gTsug-tor rnam-par-rgyal-ma), based on the Vi-
jaya-kalpal (rNam-par-rgyal-ma'i rtog-pa)2
On the hub of an eight-spoked wheel, on lotus and moon seat
is Lady Usnișa-vijaya, white, with three faces and eight arms.
The principal face is white, the right yellow and the left blue
and slightly wrathful with fangs just showing, the upper teeth
pressing on the lower lip; each face has three eyes. The first
right hand holds a crossed vajra at the heart, the second holds
a lotus with Conqueror Amitābha on it and the third an arrow,
while the fourth makes the boon-granting gesture. The first
left hand makes the threatening forefinger, with a vajra noose,
the second holds a bow, the third makes the gesture of giving
refuge, and the fourth, in meditation, holds a flask of nectar of
immortal life. She is adorned with all kinds of jewel ornaments
and has various silken garments, and sits with her legs in vajra-
paryarka.
505. Sixty-six or fifty deity Lady of Knowledge
(Rig-byed-ma) with the principal in the north-
west corner, based on the Graha-mătyka-kalpal
(gZa'-yum-gyi rtog-pa)2
In the center is the Sun, surrounded by the other eight planets-
Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu ('Eclipse')
and Ketu ('Comet). In the four gates are Buddha Bhagavan,
Vajrapani, red Lokêsvara, and Manjusri Kumārabhūta. In the
next circle, in the north-east are all the planets, in the south-
east, all the lunar constellations (naksalra); in the south-west, all
disasters (upadrava) in the north-west, the principal, as below,

In the north-westis myself, Venerable (bhattārika) Mahavidyā
(Rig-pa chen-mo), Mother of All the Planets (Sarva-graha-matrka,
gZa' thans-cad-kyi yum), white as the autumn moon, with three
faces-white, black and red-and six arms, the first pair making
the Wheel of Dharma gesture, the other two right hands holding
a lotus and a blazing jewel, the other two left a noose and a sakti
dagger. She has the aspect of a sixteen-year-old. She wears a
jewel crown and is adorned with silks and all kinds of jewel
ornaments, and sits in vajra-paryanka on a lotus and moon seat.
All the deities are crowned with a crown of the Five
Tathāgatas.

armlets (keyūra, dpun-rgyan);
bracelets (rucaka, lag-gdub);

girdle (mekhala, ska-rags);
anklets (nūpura, rkar-gdub).
The emblems (phyng-mtshan) are:
vajra (rdo-rje);
bell (ghanta, dril-bu);
damaru (dā-ma-ru or cani-te'u);
knife (kartri, gri-gug);
blood-filled skull (kapala, thod-pa);
khalvānga.
Although most of the ornaments are gold, the skull tiara and
emblems indicate a fierce deity.
CONCLUSION
Colophon of C
{Requested by the reverend Yoginī,
Mahāpandita Abhayākara-gupta
In his Nispanna-yogāvali made clear
The way the sharp-facultied might fully comprehend
In a moment the mandalas of container and contents
In accord with the meaning of the Tantras.
Realized great pandita Jagad-darpana
In his great text Kriya-samuccaya
Auspiciously added to the earlier source
Three more mandalas and other things.
Though many are the learned men who've made
Appropriate rituals for their realization,
A worthless fraudster of an aging monk
By the name of Ngawang Lozang Ch'öden,
Sparing no pains and squandering paper and ink
Has performed the task of setting them down in writing.
This kind of thing may be but useless gabble,
A laughing-stock to those who analyze;
I think, though, there will be some who will use it,
Whoever may be fortunate as I.}



Appendix
Three forms of Yamāntaka
Yamäntaka (8Śin-rje-gśed), 'Slayer of the Lord of Death', is the
fierce form of Manjusri. In his buffalo-faced aspect of Vajrabhaira-
va (rDo-rje 'jigs-byed), 'the Vajra Terrible One', he is one of the three
principal Yidam deities of Highest Yoga Tantra in the Gelukpa
tradition, along with Guhyasamaja and Sambara. Peter (1943)
already remarked on Vajrabhairava's surprising absence from the
blockprint version of our collection of images (except in simplified
form, Icon 75). In the Zürich manuscript, however, this omission
is repaired by an extra page presenting him both with consort
and without (ekavira), together with another much-used aspect of
Yamāntaka, Black Yamāri (a variant of Icon 460).
The description of Vajrabhairava is from a long sādhana by P'a-
bongk'a Rinpoche (Pha-bon-kha Rin-po-che, 1878-1941, reputed an
incarnation of Changkya Rölpei Dorje): Sadhana of Lord Śrī-vajra-
bhairava Without Consort, Victorious over the Māras, a clearly written
recitation arranged for the easy practice of less intelligent beginners.
Most of the details agree with the sādhanas and praises in the Tän-
gyur (P 2852/Toh. 1999, P 2860-65/Toh. 2007-2011). However, the
Hindu gods crushed beneath the animals and birds under Vajra-
bhairava's feet, though always shown in modern depictions of the
deity, do not seem to be mentioned in the Indian texts.
One of these texts, Meaning of the hand emblems of Sri-vajra-
bhairava by Tathāgata-rakṣita (P 2860/Toh.2007), explains much
of the symbolism
[Right hand emblems:) 1. The knife is for cutting ignorance.
2. Single-pointed vajra: for destroying the wrong concep-
tion of subject and object. 3. Pestle: for crushing deluded
thoughts. 4. Wavy-bladed knife: for cutting off activity (?
spyod-pa). 5. Single-pointed vajra: for overcoming faults of
body and speech. 6. Axe: for overcoming envy. 7. Spear:
for destroying wrong view. 8. Arrow: for performing the
activity of subjugating. 9. Hook: for summoning. 10. Club:
for overcoming obscurations of the body. 11. Khatvānga: of
the essence of Bodhicitta. 12. Wheel: for cutting off obscura-
tion of knowables. 13. Vajra: for the taste of the five Gnoses
not to deteriorate. 14. Vajra hammer: for destroying obscu-
rations of unknowing. 15. Sword: for granting the siddhi of
the magic sword. 16. Damaru: for impelling all the Buddhas
with sounds of supreme joy.
[Left hand emblems:) 1. Skull filled with various things:
his nature of Great Bliss and great compassion. 2. Brahma's
head: for overcoming all obscurations. 3. Shield: of the
nature of conquering the Māras. 4. Foot: the lack of inherent
existence of the conception of all sentient beings and all
dharmas. 5. Noose: for binding perfect Gnosis. 6. Bow:
for conquering the three worlds. 7. Entrails: for Emptiness
8. Bell: the Perfection of Wisdom. 9. Hand: because he is
the creator of all dharmas. 10. Shroud: because all dharmas
lack self-existence. 11. Man impaled on a stake: because all
dharmas are endowed with Emptiness. 12. Brazier: because
all dharmas are clear light. 13. Skull filled with liquid: for
purity of the pledges. 14. Threatening forefinger: threatening

the thirty-four arms plus his Body, Speech and Mind are the

and Mind are of a single taste. 16. Flag (ba-dan) fluttering in
the wind: because all dharmas are like light, or illusions.
The elephant-skin is for (slaying?] (illegible) the elephant

The eight (animal) seats of the right feet make clear the

mutation into gold, the elixir, the foot ointment, (extracting

[bird] seats trodden by the left feet, the vulture and so on, are
the eight masteries (dban-phyug brgyad), (concerning) attach-
ment, delusion, wrath, avarice, fear, pure speech, conscience
and slander
His buffalo face is because he possesses the three realms.
His horns are the two truths.
The P'abongk'a Rinpoche sadhana gives further explanations:
His nine faces are the nine divisions of the scriptures;
The description of Black Yamāri is drawn from a Sädhana of
Black Yamāri by Atīša in the Tängyur (P2801/Toh. 1936), slightly
expanded from the over-concise verses for clarity. The preceding
sādhana, P 2800, was also used. This is called Sadhana of Black
Yamāri, king of the wrathful, crossing to the far shore of time. It is quite
possible that its author, 'the Glorious Pandita', is also Atīša.

THREE FORMS OF YAMĀNTAKA
508. Vajrabhairava without consort' ('Jigs-byed
dpa'-gcig)
Out of Emptiness come the common guardian circle, of the four
elements and a spherical vajra wall surrounded by fire, and
the special guardian circle, myself as Sumbha-rāja (or Sumbha-
rāja) surrounded by the ten wrathful deities, each three-faced,
six-armed and with consort. Sumbha becomes white Vajra-
sattva, then a white dharmôdaya with a polylotus, crossed vajra
and white Vairocana, who becomes a palace. Outside the vajra
wall and fire are the eight charnel grounds. Amid the palace is
myself, the causal Vajradhara, Manjuśrī the Youthful (Kumāra-
bhūta), yellow, with sword and book, seated in vajra-paryanka
on a moon disk. He becomes a sun and a black vajra marked
with HŐM.2
The moon, sun, vajra and HŪM transform into a polylotus,
moon and sun seat, on which is myself, the result Vajradhara, Śrī
Vajra-mahābhairava (dPal Do-rje 'jigs-byed chen-po), dark blue,
with nine faces, thirty-four arms and sixteen legs, abiding in
pratyalidha posture (right legs bent). Capable of devouring the
three worlds, he is shouting 'Haha' and has rolled-up tongue,
bared fangs and a frown. Beside the frown, his eyebrows and
eyes blaze like the fire at the time of destruction. His pale
yellow hair streams upwards. Threatening the worldly and
supermundane gods, he terrifies even the terrible, roaring like
thunder the great sound of PIEM and eating human blood,
grease, marrow and fat. He is crowned with five frightful dry
skulls and adorned with a skull garland of fifty fresh heads,
black snake as sacred thread, a circlet of human bone, and
earrings and the other ornaments of bone. He is naked of
body, with a huge belly. His sex stands erect. His eyebrows,
eyelashes, beard and body hairs blaze like the fire at the end of
time.
His principal face is a buffalo's, black, extremely wrathful
and with sharp horns. Above this, midway between the two
horns, is a red face, most frightful, with blood dripping from
its mouth. Above this is the yellow face of Manjusri, just a
little wrathful, adorned with the ornaments of a young man,
with five locks on the crown of his head. The main face under
the right horn is blue, that to its right red, and that to its left
yellow. The main face under the left horn is white, that to its
right smoke-colored, and that to its left black. These faces are
extremely wrathful. All nine faces are three-eyed.
The first pair of arms hold a fresh elephant-skin, stretched
out with its head on the right and hands and feet on the left,
showing the hairs outside. The remaining right hands hold 1. a
knife, 2. a dart (bhindipala), 3. a wooden pestle, 4. a knife with
wavy blade, 5. a harpoon, 6. an axe, 7. a spear, 8. an arrow, 9. a
hook, 10. a club, 11. a khatvānga, 12. a wheel, 13. a five-pointed
vajra, 14. a vajra hammer, 15. a sword and 16. a damaru. The left
hold 1. a blood-filled skull, 2. Brahma's head, 3. a shield, 4. a
foot, 5. a noose, 6. a bow, 7. entrails, 8. a bell, 9. a hand, 10. a
shroud, 11. a man impaled on a stake, 12. a brazier, 13. a piece
of a skull, 14. a threatening forefinger, 15. a triple banderole
and 16. a fan (rlun-ras, also 'prayer-flag').
His right feet tread on 1. a human being, 2. a buffalo, 3. an
ox, 4. an ass, 5. a camel, 6. a dog, 7. a sheep and 8. a fox (or
jackal); his left feet on 1. a vulture, 2. an owl, 3. a raven, 4. a
parrot, 5. a hawk, 6. a garuda, 7. a domestic fowl and 8. a swan.
He also tramples beneath his feet Brahmä, Indra, Visnu, Rudra,
Six-faced Kumāra (= Kārttikeya), Vinayaka (Ganesa), Candra
and Surya, lying face down. In this manner he abides amid an
intensely blazing mass of fire.
At his eyes is the essence of Kșitigarbha, white KSIM; at his
ears the essence of Vajrapāni, black JRIM; at his nose the essence
of Khagarbha, yellow KHAM; on his tongue the essence of Ava-
lokita, red RAM; on his brow the essence of Nīvarana-viskam-
bhin, green KAM; and at his navel the essence of Samantabhadra,
white SAM. At his crown is the essence of Vajra Body, a white
OM; at his throat the essence of Vajra Speech, red Äh; and at his
heart the essence of Vajra Mind, blue HÜM.
At the heart of this Pledge-being, on a moon seat, is the
Gnosis-being, Manjusri the Youthful, yellow, just a little wrath-
ful, his right hand brandishing a sword and his left holding a
book, and seated in vajra-paryanka. Adorned with the thirty-
two Marks and eighty Signs, he has five braids of hair and is
decorated with all the ornaments.
At his heart, from AH comes a sun disk, in the center of which
is the Concentration-being, a blue HŪM radiating five-colored
light

C. OTHER ICONOGRAPHIC COLLECTIONS
Table 6. The Three Hundred Images
Col. 1,300 I': number of image in the Changkya Qutuytu Röl-
päi dorje pantheon known as the Three Hundred Images (see
Translator's Introduction, p. 229). The numbering is consistent
in all the editions inspected.
Col. 2, 'IWS': icon number of the image in Icons Worthwhile to See
judged to correspond most closely.
Unlike the concordance tables given above, this table and the
next are necessarily inexact and subjective. Where there are
several iconographically equivalent images to choose from, names
and mantras have been used to narrow the field. Where there
is no exact equivalent, the most similar in form, emblems and
name is given, marked ('approximately equal'). If several icon
numbers are prefixed by , none is an exact match. Comments
on differences may be found with the text for the relevant icon.
As in the indexes, entries in angle brackets mark attendant
deities mentioned in our source texts but not illustrated in IWS.
Some 129 images in 3001 lacking even an approximate counter-
part in IWS have been omitted from the table.
Sometimes, a match is given for a set of deities as well as for the
individual deities making up the set. In such cases the set has been
matched based on the identities of its deities, not their detailed
iconography, and better individual iconographic matches may be
found elsewhere.

Table 7. The Ngor Mandalas
Col. 1, 'Ngor': serial number of the Ngor mandala in the sources
cited in the Translator's Introduction.
Col. 2, 'IWS': icon number of the image in Icons Worthwhile to See
judged to correspond most closely.
Although only Part Three derives directly from a collection of
mandalas as such, many of the deities in the other parts of IWS
have attendants that are or could be arranged in mandalas. Alto-
gether there are approximately 128 mandalas and groups of three
or more deities described in the sources of IWS; while the Ngor
collection comprises 139 mandalas, including some that are prac-
tically duplicates and some mandalas consisting of only a single
deity. Thus the two collections are quite comparable in size and
it was thought of interest to attempt to correlate them. Compar-
ison is based on the name and main iconographic features of the
principal deities and the names of the attendants. (Details of the
attendants have, of course, been omitted from Part Three above.)
There is in fact surprisingly little overlap between the two
collections: overall, barely one mandala in four in either collection
is found also in the other, though in Part Three of IWS more than
half have a match in the Ngor set.
In the table below, besides the symbol for approximate
equality we use the subset (C) and superset() signs when the
Ngor mandala comprises just some of the deities of the IWS mandala
or vice versa. '' means only the principal deity of the Ngor
mandala is found in the IWS rite indicated; these cases do not
count as matches and the listing is not intended to be exhaustive
with regard to them.

General Index and Glossary
Coverage
For speed of reference, and to avoid extensive duplication of
entries, all the following are included here in a single encyclopedic
listing in English alphabetical order:
1. All proper names, including deities, persons, places
and texts, in the forms given in the text and captions,
with cross-references from some other forms;
2. The attributes of deities: all the hand-emblems and
gestures, together with any other attributes poten-
tially helpful for identification;
3. Glossary: explanations of Sanskrit words and other
technical terms; Sanskrit and Tibetan originals of
words and names used in the translations;
4. Articles analyzing particular elements of the texts
and how they are represented in the paintings.
Coverage of deity names and hand-emblems is exhaustive for the
deities illustrated. Other attributes are not necessarily indexed if
they occur too widely to be of appreciable help in identifying a
deity, though they will of course appear as glossary entries.
Attendants who are not illustrated are indexed by name if they
were mentioned in the section of the source text translated, but
their attributes are only indexed if of particular interest.
When a deity name is found only in a mantra, this is indicated.
Many of the epithets judged more significant from praises and
mantras are included, though it would be neither appropriate nor
practicable to index every phrase or word applied to a deity.
The references
The index refers throughout to icon numbers, except where
otherwise indicated. When an icon illustrates more than one deity,
they are identified by lower-case letters--'p' for a prajñā (female
consort), 'v' for a vehicle, or else as shown in the key with the
Plate caption and indicated in the text.
In the case of hand-emblems and gestures the icon number
may be followed by an expression identifying the hand-'R' for
the right hand, 'L' for the left, and a number if there is more than
one pair of hands. For example, 'R3' denotes the third right hand,
'L2' the second left hand, 'RL' both hands of a two-armed deity.
When necessary, the same system is extended to the feet-RFn'
for the nth right foot and so on.
In this way we can refer simultaneously to both the Plates and
the text. Of course, some items by their nature are not to be
found in the Plates. Other items that could in principle have
been depicted in the relevant icon but are not are placed in angle
brackets (...) to save fruitless search, while other features noted in
the icon but absent from or differing from the textual description
are marked with square brackets [...].
Arrangement
It will be noted that the references in the articles on the deities are
arranged in a systematic order, approximating a descending order
of visibility and importance. At the end of the appropriate section,
or of the whole article, cross-references to other index entries and
other parts of the book, and sometimes external references, may
appear, introduced by the symbol ''.

General Index & Glossary
Many of the hand-emblems and gestures are discussed and
illustrated in the Pictorial Index. References to this usually
precede the specific references to deities and are given in the form
'PI', followed by the number of the article in the Pictorial Index.
Sanskrit has been reconstructed from the Tibetan. When several
alternative Sanskrit or Tibetan equivalents appear, those more
frequent in the present texts are generally given first.
Sometimes an English translation of a name is added at the
same point. Unless it has been actually used, e.g. as the title of
a translated text, this is placed in quotation marks, to emphasize
that it is no more than a literal rendering of the words.
Deity form
A number of principal articles on deities include listing 'by form
and color'. Here the form is described simply by the numbers of
faces, arms and legs, e.g., '11f32a8l' means 11 faces, 32 arms and 8
legs. When all the forms are two-legged, the number of legs may
be omitted.
Sanskrit and Tibetan
The Tibetan equivalents given after the headwords are as they
appear in the texts; the parts within parentheses are not always
present. Where possible, the Tibetan is preceded by a Sanskrit
equivalent, derived from Nispanna-yogávali, from mantras or other
transcriptions in the text, or from a reliable external source such as
Maha-vyutpatti. When the Sanskrit is only one of several possible
reconstructions, or is otherwise doubtful, it is preceded by an
asterisk. An 'equation of the form (Tib.) = (Skt) also means the
naria

Avalokita (sPyan-ras-gzigs): the Bodhisattva of Com-
passion, and patron deity of Tibet.
Avalokita means literally the act of looking at,
"beholding'the Tib, has much the same meaning,
i.e. the Bodhisattva 'whose broad eyes always
behold all sentient beings, with the nature of
love combining in one the essence of the Speech
of all the Buddhas' (Bic). His Mon. n., Qongšim
bodisadu, comes from Kuan-shil-yin Bodhisatt
where Kuan-shih-yin is his Chinese n., 'Hearer of
the Cries of the World'.
His usual title is Arya, to the extent that a
name like 'Eleven-faced Arya' actually implies
Arya-avalokita. Aryâvalokita is occasionally
expanded to Aryâvalokitesvara ('Phags-pa spyan-
mas-gzigs dban-phyug, 'Lord Arya-avalokita'), to
which in scriptures such as the Heart Satra the
further titles Bodhisattva and Mahasatton are
added.
Avalokitesvara without Arya is not found in
our texts, except in Tibetan verse, where the
truncated form sPyan-ras-gzigs-dban is metrically
convenient. It is unfortunate that this aberrant
usage has become so strongly established
English, when we would be more justified in
using simply Avalokita or (if honorific is
desired) Árya-avalokita. The injudicious choice
of Analokitesvara
many
Western followers
of Tibetan Buddhism prefer the Tibetan name,
Chenrezik, although they use the Indian names
for the other Indian Buddhist deities.
Also called Mahā-kāruņika, the Greatly Com-
passionate': Loka-nātha or Lokêśvara, 'Lord of
the World'.

tal awareness on the part of one dwelling in
the family of those on the Path, impelled by the
spontaneous desire to strive for the welfare of
others and similar to the wish for Enlightenment
as an aid (after Btc). Generation of Bodhicitta is
divided into ultimate and conventional, the com-
passionate motivation falling into the latter cat-
egory while the former involves a realization of
ultimate True Nature, Emptiness. It is also clas-
sified into four or twenty-two grades according
to the degree of progress along the Bodhisattva

mind is an essential preliminary to any Maha-
yåna practice.

sole aim is thus to benefit others. The Tib.,

COLORS (sku-mdog): 1. The colors that count as
iconographically distinct for the bodies of deities are
very few:
character of the deity.
Some deities, such as Sākyamuni Buddha and
the Sixteen Elders, are monks and therefore wear
a monk's robes, the design of which is laid down
in some detail in the Vinaya rules.
Other fully enlightened deities mostly conform
the peaceful or the fierce types. The
usual mark of a fierce deity by way of clothing is
the tiger-skin loincloth; the deity may well wear
little else except for ornaments. Peaceful deities
are usually more extensively clad in silk. The
texts rarely use terms that are specific as to the
form of a garment, but speak rather of 'garments
of heavenly stuffs' (Iha-rdzas-kyi na-bza') or 'upper
garments' stod-yyogs) and lower garments (Sam-
Thabs, smad-yyogs, smad-dkris, smad-gos) of silk.
A lower garment can be a skirt, a loincloth,
leggings or even (442) trousers, but an
a 'upper
garment' is a scarf draped round the shoulders,
as distinct from a (sleeveless) vest (sa-"gag(s)).
Märíci's bodice' or close-fitting jacket (kaficuka)
mentioned in the Skt (502) becomes simply a
'garment' (gos) in the Tib and is depicted as a
tenuous scarf leaving her practically naked above
the waist.
Quite different clothing is found among the
wealth deities and protectors, including Maha-
kāla, Sri-devi and the Four Great Kings. They
wear such items as the corslet of lacquered
leather, a large or flowing cloak, with a gold belt
and boots (most often of shagreen), or fluttering
garments of
of black or assorted silks. Sri-devi also
wears a hair petticoat
It often seems that as regards clothing, the
artist is loath to let the rather random remarks
in a textual description override details of the
standard type he is depicting. For example, when
colors are specified, such as white silk (109
11 a) or black silk (see cloak), the artist typically
ignores them and paints
colored
brocade; a 'tiger-skin coat (stag-slog, 358 t) is
shown as a loincloth. But scarves of animal or
human skin, such as Avalokita's deer-skin, are
recognized as important characteristic marks of a
deity and painted with care.

smoke-colored (dhamra-warna; dud-kha, di-ba'i

Among these, blue and black are distinguished in
name only, both being regularly represented as a
dark blue; although the terms tend to be kept dis-
tinct in translation and from one text to another,
they are used interchangeably for different but
identically-colored parts of the same deity (eg. Kala-
cakra 497).
There is no such ambiguity between green and
black: these colors have different roles and symbol-
ism in Buddhist Tantra and could never be confused
by a practitioner. Thus Ijai-gu cannot possibly be
translated as black'.
2. Some shades are mentioned, but are not always
differentiated from the principal color by the artist
The most important is orange (dmar-ser), Manju-
ghosa's color. Others noted are:
off-white (dkar-Sam);

white with a tinge of red (Tsad-raktänuviddha-site-
carna; akar-po-la cun-zad dmar-ba'i mdans-dan

white with a bluish tint (dkar-la sio-ba'i mdans-

pale yellow (gaura; kham-ser (po), dkar-ser);
pink (dmar-skya);
vermilion (rgya-tshos-kyi kha-dog);
dark red (dmar-nag);
purple (dmar-smug, smug-po); dark purple (smug-

amilies (kula; rigs): in the two higher classes of
Tantras, there are five Families of deities: Vai-
rocana's Tathāgata Fº, Aksobhya's Vajra Fº
Ratnasambhava's Jewel (Ratna) FC, Amitabha's
Lotus (Padma) Fº, and Amogha-siddhi's Action
(Karma) F'. These tend to be
north respectively in a
mandala, though other dispositions are possible.
A sixth Fº, Vajrasattva's, may be added in the
zenith, embodying primordial Buddhahood in
which the five differentiated aspects expressed in
the five F are merely implicit.

1976: 82-8).
In Action and Performance Tantras, there are
three supermundane Families: in descending
order of rank, Tathāgata, Padma and Vajra. Their
Lords are Sakyamuni, Amitāyus and Aksobhya.
In addition, there are three worldly F, of which
the Wealthy F (nor-can-gyi rigs) is represented
in our texts. For more details, > headings of
Narthang Gyatsa; LW: Chap. III. On the likely
historical progression from three to four to five to
six Fº, Snellgrove, ITB: 189–98.
In general, each Buddha-family is adapted to
the purification of
of a particular poison or defile
ment; a disciple in whom that defilement pre-
dominates should
ould practice a deity of that Fam-
ily. For
example, one most given to anger should
practice a deity of the Vajra Fº.
The Foto
he to which a deity belongs is indicated
by the Lord of the F that he or she bears in
miniature on the crown of the head, especially
after self-empowerment. A deity is often said to

these fortresses with the bse demons, as he would

the material. Firstly, bsе-mkhar is in one of

front generation (mdun-bskyed): section of a deity
ritual in which one builds up a visualized image
of a deity or an entire mandala in front of oneself,
generally while identifying oneself with another
deity, invokes the Gnosis-being(s) into it, and
performs praise, offerings, etc., focussed upon
it. In some practices, this is a preliminary stage
to self-generation, but there are also deities with
whom it is inappropriate to identify oneself,
who are practiced primarily in front generation.
These include on the one hand Gurus such as
Lama Tsongk'apa, and on the other all Protectors
except Mahākāla, and a miscellany of semi-divine
figures.
Deities practiced only in front generation in
the present collection include Ganapati (whose
status is so equivocal he is sometimes wor-
shipped and sometimes trampled on), Vaisravana
and the rest of the Four Great Kings, the yaksas
Aparajita, Hāritr, Jinarsabha, Kundhali, Mani-
bhadra, Nada-kubera and Vajra-māradama, the
nāga-king Apalāla, the Yuk-g'u-ma sisters, and
Trashi 'Ts'eringma and her sisters.
Sākyamuni and the wealth deities Vasudhärā
and Jambhala are often practiced in front genera-
tion but also in self-generation.
A Yidam usually practiced in self-generation
may be practiced in front generation occasionally:
Amitäyus 179, Avalokita 198, Garuda 231, Maha-
māyā 54, Märīcī 195.

Ganapati (Tshogs-ſkyi) bdag-/po); "Master of the
Hosts'): an elephant-headed god worshipped by
both Hindus and Buddhists. The hosts he is mas-
ter of are those of hindering demons, thus he is
capable of both causing hindrances and removing
them. This ambiguity is reflected I in his
nāyaka, which can mean either 'remover (of hin-
drances)' or 'leader-astray', and in his treatment
in Buddhist Tantra, where he is
is sometimes wor-
shipped as a deity (only in f.g.) and sometimes
trampled on. Even as a deity he has the dubi-
ous distinction of being the only Buddhist deity
portrayed undergoing oral sex, and that with a
monkey (334).

gods (deva: Iha) and goddesses (deor, l-mo): in Eng-
lish, it is convenient to make a distinction be-
tween 'deities', who are a proper object of Refuge
for Buddhist practitioners, and mundane gods,
such as the Hindu gods, who are not. In Tib. and
Skt, the same words are used for both. The mun-
dane gods are typically shown in Buddhist Tantra
being trampled on by Buddhist deities as sign
of
mastery over the forces of nature they often
represent; however, many of them have been
converted to the service of the true Dharma and
are portrayed favorably in Buddhist scriptures
and rites, notably Brahmā and Indra (or Sakra).
Some, such as Ganapati (Ganesa) and Yama, have
a dual role, sometimes trampled and sometimes
honored with their own rites.
The mundane goddesses appear only as con
sorts of the gods, so there is little danger of con-
fusion in using the term 'Goddess' for female
deities also

mandala red, triangular and adorned with
tura ornaments to which blazing garlands
adhere. Above this, from vam, the water
mandala, white, round and marked with flasks.
Above this, from LAM, the earth mandala,
yellow, square and marked with mujras. Upon
this, from HOM comes a crossed vajra marked
in the center with HUM. From it light-rays
spread downwards, (making) a vajra ground;
sideways, (making a vajra wall; upwards.
[making a vajra pavilion, and above the lower
walls of the pavilion a vajra canopy. All this is
of the nature of blazing vajra, in a single piece
without a break. Outside it, a five-colored
mass of fire like the fire of cosmic destruction
to the ten directions.

well be restricted to Highest Yoga Tantra Yidams.

Jämāri (Dză-ma-ri): also spelt Jamări or Yamāri. An
eleventh-century logician, whose huge commen-

longest in the Tg. Täranātha recounts how, when
he was in poverty, a yogin he sheltered gave him
the practice of Vasudhārä, which brought him
riches (HBI 308). He therefore wrote a hymn to
Vasudhärā (P 4574/Toh. 3752), as well as a sadhana
of Aparājita Yaksa (P4575/Toh. 3754).

Śravana, be called 'Protector Guarding the North',
he is never styled King'; his usual title is
Arya. He also lacks Vaisravana's strong connec-
tion with Vajrapāni. He has many sadhanas in Sm
(284-9, 291-9). His chief attributes are the citron
and the mongoose.

Jonangpa (Jo-nan-pa): a school of Tibetan Buddhism
distinguished by its philosophical teaching of

the Indian Mind Only school. It takes its name
from the monastery of Jomonang, or Jonang
P'ünts'ok-ling, on the Tsangpo some 90 km w of
Shigatse. Täranātha was its last famous adherent.
Not long after his death, its monasteries were
confiscated by the Fifth Dalai Lama and handed
over to the Gelukpas.

branching out into twenty-four forearms and his
elaborate color scheme, and the mandala with its
634 deities, are far more complicated than any
other in this collection and their description occu-
15% of Nya all to themselves.
Generalizations about Buddhist Tantra tend
to need modifying for Kālacakra. For example,
the system has a different color symbolism, and
a set of ten naga-kings (see 73, 229) instead of
the usual eight. It uses more Hindu terminology
than other Buddhist Tantras, and is the only one
to include goddesses called saktis.

of leather lacquered or varnished on the tanned
outer side; or ras-bse (cloth-bse), cloth built up
in layers with flour paste or painted, lacquered
or varnished. The kind of mask called bse-bag
is made from ras-bse (thus bse-'bag does in fact
mean 'mask made of bse-glued strips of cloth-
rather than 'mask of the face of a bse-demon' as
Per Kværne proposes (ODT X*-XI*)). The corslet
called bse-khrab, on the other hand, is made from
ko-bse; such armor of
leather has also
been used in Japan. Animal hide, incidentally,
is still the best material available for resisting
stabbing (Cross 1996).
The basic meaning of hse, covering both types,
would seem to be: a material built up by succes-
sive applications of a sticky substance that dries
hard.

MANTRA (mantra, vidya; snags, rig-pw, etc.): a sacred
formula addressed to any individual deity (MW).
Mantras being so crucial to its practice, Tantra or
Vajrayana is often called Mantra or the Mantra
Vehicle.
At the heart of a deity there is usually a moon
or sun disk, on the center of which stands upright
a single mantric syllable, the seed ((hrd)-bija; (snin-
ga'i) sa-bon, thugs-kar sa-hon) of the deity. This is
surrounded by the syllables of the heart mantra
(ırdaya-(mantra); sñini-po'i srags)). Aroun this
again often stand the syllables of a near-heart mº
(upahrdaya; ře-m'i) sħiin-(po)). Each Yidam deity also
has a root mº (müla-mº; rtsa-(h'i) srags), which may
be distinct from the heart mº. Associated with each
complete mandala is a a single all-purpose mº (saron-
karmika-mº; los (thams-cad-pai) srags), which is often
the individual mº of one of the attendant deities.
One or other of the above will be recited a hun-
dred thousand times or more in the practice of the
deity, with appropriate visualization.
Many other types of recitation mº are also men-
tioned in our texts, including the following:
accomplishment mº (sgrub-pa'i srags); for the accom-
plishment stage of practice, entered upon when
the
service stage has been completed;
ati-hrdaya-
myan-sñin): 'the heart of the heart [m®.
no doubt visualized inside the heart mº;
(spel-tskig dari beas-pa) m”: the heart
mº with a particular request added. The added
words may be in any language, not necessarily
that of the original mº;
m of body, speech and mind (sku-gsun-thugs-kyi
stags): a deity can have separate body, speech
and mind m®, but that of 165 is a single mº,
though divided into three phrases:

entwined round ordinary ornaments.
Some important ornaments worn only by wrathful
deities must be mentioned:
the garland or long necklace of fifty human heads
(nr)-mundo-mala, pulīcāśan-nara-sirah-treni, ni
mgo (ina-bcu/'i phren-ba); the heads may be
'moist' (Ardra; rlon-pa), i.e. freshly severed and
still dripping with blood, or (more rarely) ‘dry
(suska; skam-po), i.e. bare skulls;
the three substances smeared on the body, viz.,
spots of blood (khrag-gi thig-le) on the cheeks,
smears of fat (ag-gi zo-ris) on the chin or
throat, and a dot of human ash (thal-chen-gyl
Eskom-bu) between the eyebrows, e.g. 153.
ORNAMENTS: the most important are the five or
six symbolic ornaments (circlet, earrings, choker,
bracelets and girdle, and for male deities only,
ashes), symbolizing the Buddhas of the Five (or Six)
Families. 'Bracelets' implies armlets and anklets as
well. Also common are:
crown (mukuta; cod-pan, dhu-rgyan), > head orna-
ments;
jewel on top of the head (cldamani, gtsug-gi nor-
bu);
long necklace (do-sal), hanging down well below
the waist; se-ral-kha seems to be used synony-
mously with do-sal in R, though PTA: HA and
Btc indicate it is worn over the right shoulder
and under the left armpit;
necklace
with pendant (se-mo-do);
armlets (keyara; dpwrt-rgyan, dpungdub) (507);
anklets (nüpura; rkan-gdub, Sabs-gdub) (507): these
may be counted in with the bracelets; some-
times they bear strings of little bells (yer-kha'i
phren-ba);
sacred thread (yajñopavita, brahma-sutra; mchod-
phyir-thogs, tshans-skyud);
sash (ga-sa, ga-Sal), actually a pair of crossed
sashes going over each shoulder and under
the opposite armpit and joined in the center of
the chest (e.g. 491; cf. Btc and PTA: HA, 6);
rings on the fingers (sor-gdub).
The above may be of different materials and design,
depending on the deity. Ornaments of gold and

the Perfections of a Bodhisattva, is direct insight
into ultimate nature; the holding of a book of

session of this insight. In many cases where a

Perfections, six or ten (paramita; phar-phyin): the six
are, in order: Giving, Morality, Patience, Energy,
Concentration and Wisdom. The practice of the
first five is called Method, and results in the
accumulation of merits; the practice of wisdom in
the accumulation of Gnosis. Completion of both
accumulations is necessary to Enlightenment.
Sometimes four higher Perfections are added
(skilful means, prayer or aspiration, power, and
gnosis) to make one for each Stage of the Bodhi-
sattva Path.

by the relevant vows and pledges. D conferral

of the synonyms for padma such as abja, ambuja,
ambhoja, kamala, pankaja, saroja, saroruha; chu-skyes,
mtsho-skyes): a large lotus serving as the seat
of a deity or deities. The specially coined Eng.
word is offered as a concise, literal translation
that does not prejudge debate as to whether
the lotus is multiple by way of having many
colors, many petals, many layers of petals, or
some combination. Ble's definition of the term
as 'an eight-petaled lotus whose petals in the four
cardinal directions are red, the SE and NW petals
yellow, the SW green, and the NE black' does not
seem to be widely accepted. Deities' seat lotuses
are usually depicted with more than eight petals
and I have yet to find an example of this color
scheme. However, there are more than a dozen
mentions of an eight-petaled polylotus (76, 300,
313, 461-2, 465-71, 475, 492) and just one of a
four-petaled polylotus (89-97),
According to Beer 1999: 41, the polylotus is
a multicolored lotus with two rows of double
petals, the main petals facing upwards and the
smaller, lower petals facing downwards. Visva
thus denotes a doubling, as it does in visua-wajra.
Usage of the term varies from text to text. In
R, just some seat lotuses are called polylotuses, in
K none are, and in N and practically all are.
Polylotus the size of a cartwheel 178; red lotus
transforming into polylotus 145-9.
POSTURES (dug-stan): The present work provides
an exceptional opportunity for comparing the ver-
bal descriptions of deities' postures with their visual
representation. We find that some of the postures
are in reality less well defined than the explanations
in Western books on Buddhist art suggest. There is
considerable mismatch between the terms and the
actual set of
postures found in the plates: several
of the commonest terms refer to a range of differ-
ent postures, while a given observed posture can be
referred to by any of several different names. This
is one reason why I have kept the Sanskrit terms
in my translation. Of course, by qualifying a pos-
ture name the posture intended can be specified pre-
cisely, but this is often not done.
The
table below is confined to those deities who
both appear in the relevant plate and have their
posture stated in the source text. For each posture
description, it categorizes the deities according to
how the posture is represented visually. "(+p) indi-
cates that the deity is in union with a sexual partner;
though the posture is unaffected it may be partially
obscured.
1. Ambiguous postures
Surprisingly, the iconographic description of a de-
ity quite often fails to indicate whether the deity is

Protector of the Doctrine or Dharma-protector
(dharma-pala, chos-skyon): a guardian abiding in
vows that make him or her protect properly the
Doctrine, the Dharma (taught by the Buddha]

kāla and Sridevi are realized beings, included
among the objects of Refuge (though in the low-
est rank), but there are also worldly protectors,
such as local devis, yaksas, etc., who though en-
dowed with some paranormal powers are mere
samsaric beings, under an obligation to help
practitioners. One may call on their aid and re-
ward them with offerings, but should not aspire
to their condition.
Protectors are only obliged to help one so
long as one is practicing purely; if one strays
they can put hindrances in one's way. Therefore
one should treat them with respect and ask their
forgiveness for any unwitting offence.

given Tantra together with its associated Explana-
tory Tantra(s), commentaries and oral teachings,
usually centered on a particular deity: e.g., 'the T.
of Heruka'.
II. (rgyud-sde): 1. Division of the Dharma, op-
posed to Sūtra (mdo-sde): the Secret Mantra (Gulya-
mantra; gSan-sags) or Vajrayana (+Dor-rjel'i) theg-
pa) side of the Mahāyāna. 2. A class or category of
Tantras. We shall discuss the most common such
classification
The four classes of Tantras
Tantras are conventionally grouped into four main
categories (rgyud-sde bži):
(a) Action Tantras (Kriya-tantra) (K);
(b) Performance Tantras (Carya-tantra) (C);
(c) Yoga Tantras (Yoga-tantra) ();
(d) Highest Yoga Tantras (Anuttara-yoga-tanfra)
(A).
From (a) to (d) they become increasingly difficult,
the vows and pledges to be kept in their practice
more and more demanding. Thus for the practi-
tioner, the classes are in effect a series of levels of
practice. From the Western, historical point of view,
the progression also represents a sequence of devel-
opment of the teachings.
The assignment of a Tantr of these classes
depends on quite subjective judgments (Tsong-ka-
pa 1977: 162-4), and so is sometimes debatable
(cf. 500). Further, even if the source Tantra and its
classification are known, this does not necessarily
determine the class of a sadhana derived from it; for
example, Süryagupta's sūdhanas for the 21 Täras
(257-99), though based on the Praise in Twenty-
one Homages, which comes from an Action Tantra,
are Highest Yoga Tantra. Internal indications are
conclusive,
e.g. the
forms of the four empowerments in the conferral
rite implies a Highest Yoga Tantra practice, but
their absence means little. The presence of an inner
offering indicates a higher class, Y or A (usually A);
its absence suggests (but does not prove) a lower
class, K or C (usually K). The firmest indication is
the common instruction 'transform the offerings the
Action Tantra way' or 'the Anuttara way'.

Uccărya (U-tsarya, U-tsirya); Vajrapāņi 153.
Ucchuşma (sMe-brisegs, rMe-brisegs. 'Chol-Wa)wrath-
ful deity, styled either 'Wrathful" (Khro-bo) or
"Wrathful king' (Kuro-(boʻi) rgyal-(po)). Mantra n.
Ucuşma maha-krodha-raja.
Wrathful U was practiced in China, where
a late 9th century painting of him was found
Dunhuang (Whitfield & Farrer, no. 62). His
hinese n., 'the Unclean', resembles the Tib..
"Spotty', and he was regarded as the subduer
unclean influences (Waley 1931: 74-5); the
U of the Kg praise P 420/Toh.756 is likewise
largely concerned with purifying the impure.
Several other Dunhuang paintings depict him as
an attendant of Avalokita, paired with Hayagrīva
(Waley no. XXXV) or Kundali
dali (Nicolas-Vandier
nos. 97, 101, 103).
The Mon. n. in our MS, Mengge dabqurliysan,
can be translated 'He who doubled the birth-
mark', doubtless
equivalent to the Tib.
In Japan, Uº is identified with Vajra-yakşa,
one of the five Kings of Knowledge (vidya-raja),
who like our 225 is dark
green, with
three faces and six arms, holding a vajra and bell
(Takaaki Sawa 1972. Figs. 66, 116).
The wealth deity Ucchuşma-jambhala, some-
times called simply Ucchusma, does not appear
to be related to this UⓇ. His n. in Tib. is 'Chol-
ba, 'confused, mistaken, topsy-turvy' (Muy 4332;
P 4564-5), or in the title of P 4089 Tshon-po, 'fat'.
None of these translations of the name cor-
responds with the supposed meaning of Skt tic-
chusina, 'fire', 'the roaring of fire', a n. of Agni
(MW). Ucuşma may well have a quite different

vajra-paryarika (rdo-rje'i skyil-krun; 'the ujra cross-

the right foot on top on the left thigh. It is a
very common posture for peaceful deities. Unlike
other common posture names its meaning never

ture names. In Buddhist Tantra it is never called
the Lotus position, which name reserved for
the posture of the sexual partner of a deity in
wajra paryanika.

a wand', but the n. is puzzling as there is no sign
of a club or staff in the iconography, nor
of any
connection with time. Conceivably it may derive
from Dandaki, the n. of a tribe. Addressed as
'great yoginis'; mantra n. Malu-pisaciniye.

Index of Sanskrit Names
Scope
This index covers the Sanskrit (or related Indic) names of deities,
persons, places and texts. Many are taken directly from our
sources, either from Nispanna-yogâvali or from the Tibetan texts,
where they occur in mantras or are simply used in translitera-
tion rather than being translated into Tibetan. Others are 're-
constructed' from the Tibetan version, wherever it is plausible
to suppose this could have arisen by translation from an Indian
original.
For most of the deities, W.E. Clark (1937) provided Sanskrit
names, which have been extensively quoted by Lokesh Chandra
and others. Lokesh Chandra even put them in his Tibetan-Sanskrit
Dictionary as if they were primary source material, but in fact many
were arbitrary and speculative reconstructions from the Tibetan,
made without reading the relevant sādhana. Although Clark used
Tg titles where available, some of these in turn were reconstruc-
tions by Cordier. Inevitably, study of the sādhanas has shown some
of these earlier interpretations to be incorrect. In cases where the
reconstruction remains uncertain, we have sometimes preferred
one different from Clark's, or listed an alternative in addition to
his version.
Many name elements given in Sanskrit in this index appear
only in English (or in Tibetan and English) in the text (and/or
captions) either because they were too banal to burden the text
with the Sanskrit equivalent, or because their Sanskrit form is too
uncertain. Thus those in search of a Sanskrit equivalent not given
in the text may well be able to find a suggestion here.

Index of Tibetan Names
Scope
This index covers the Tibetan names of deities, persons, places
and texts, including Tibetan transcriptions of Sanskrit names, as
they appear in the captions and/or the source texts. One or two
names from other sources, or reconstructed from Mongolian, are
also referenced.
Conventions
Many names occur in a variety of forms, with certain syllables
omitted or included at will and with variant spellings. The
existence of such variations is noted, but they are not generally
indexed separately; rather, entries relating to a particular deity
are collected under one form of the name and cross-references
are provided from other forms when these are separated from
the main entry by the alphabetical ordering. Letters or syllables
enclosed in round brackets (...) have been omitted by our sources
in at least one occurrence of the name.
Unfortunately, time did not permit setting this index in Tibetan
script, which would have entailed extensive development work
and retyping. In transliteration, names must be capitalized. Of
the three systems for this in common use--first letter, root letter
or first pronounced letter-the second is admittedly the easiest to
follow in a Tibetan-ordered list; but as it differs from the third,
used in the body of the book, in only a small proportion of words,
it was decided to retain the latter system here for consistency's
sake and capitalize the first pronounced letter in each name.
Italicized headwords are the names of texts.
Authorities disagree over some details of Tibetan alphabetical
ordering; the system of the Bod-rgya tshig-mdzod chen-mo appears
the most logical and is generally adopted here.
As in all the indexes, references are to icon numbers unless
otherwise indicated.
Special abbreviations
(A) Attendant ("khor)
Crowning a deity as Chief of Family

(G) Guru (author or transmitter of a prac-
tice, esp. one the tradition (lugs) is
named after)

Index of Mongolian Names
The names in the Mongolian captions to IWS include many tran-
scribed phonetically from Tibetan and Sanskrit. These transcrip-
tions include several letters supplementary to the ordinary Mon-
golian alphabet:
c ('ts') transcribes Sanskrit c, ch and ; and Tibetan ts, tsh and dz,
besides the s in Vasudhară and even the jň of Jhana.
z is the special transcription character for Tibetan 2, though c is
also used for this.
Special signs for ñ, ņ and anusvāra (m) occur occasionally.
Tibetan i before a vowel is rather astonishingly transcribed as
av (read in some contexts as no; ne (see below) is also a possible
reading).
Several standard letters also appear in variant forms in the
transcriptions. The most striking is a large hook extending down
to the left like the consonant v, often used to transcribe a Tibetan
e. This has been transliterated as e. Also conspicuous is k or g
written with crossed strokes, unlike the usual k or g. When the
same sign is marked with two dots, its transliteration has been
adjusted to y. The minor eccentricities of usage denoted in the
caption transcriptions by d and I are ignored in this index.
Our system of alphabetical sorting (after Sárközi & Szerb 1995)
treats y j ñ öš as separate letters, following csinosu
respectively, and puts q after k.
Users of this index should bear in mind that unavoidably,
the transliterations are often quite arbitrary. Mongolian script is
remarkable not only for its direction of writing but for its degree
of ambiguity; and this is at its worst in transcribed Tibetan and
Sanskrit names, where the guides of meaning and vowel harmony
that reduce the ambiguities in ordinary Mongolian words scarcely
apply.

Pictorial Index
M
Robert Beer
This index has two main functions. Firstly, the drawings serve to
assist the recognition of hand-emblems and gestures that may be found
on paintings and statues. Using the names given in the numbered
headings, reference can be made to the General Index and Glossary
or to the Identification Guide, either of which may then enable the
deity to be identified. When the headword for the Glossary entry is
not immediately obvious from the heading, or when several entries are
relevant an explicit cross-reference, or a list of cross-references separated
by semicolons, is given at the end of the article.
When more than one drawing is given for a single heading, the text
of the article should be examined for further details.
The other feature of this index is the explanatory articles, compiled
especially for this book by the artist, discussing the functions and
symbolic meanings of each emblem and often mentioning also variations
that occur with particular deities. Unlike the Glossary, where related
articles are scattered by the accidents of alphabetical order, here groups
of related items are brought together. The articles are thus arrang in
a reasonably logical order and may well be read sequentially by anyone
who desires a thorough grounding in the principles of Tibetan Buddhist
symbology
Numerical cross-references within the text refer to other articles in the
Pictorial Index if they are in bold type and to icon numbers otherwise.

A. MAIN RITUAL IMPLEMENTS AND WEAPONS
1a
1b
Non
nine pointed vajras
1. The vajra (rdo-rje)
The vajra or thunderbolt was originally a spiked metal
weapon of the Vedic sky god, Indra. The Buddha is
said to have bent the sharp prongs of this indestruc-
tible weapon together to form a peaceful scepter, sym-
bolizing the indestructible reality of his Enlightenment.
The term cujra means 'the hard or mighty one', and its
Tibetan name rdo-rje lord of stones' is sometimes
equated with diamond. As a tantric Buddhist scepter
the wjra is invariably held in a deity's right hand,
symbolizing the male
principle of Method or skilful
means, and it is very often paired with the ritual bell
held in the left hand, symbolizing the female principle
of Wisdom or discriminating awarene
e pairing
of the vajra and bell represents the perfect union of
Method and Wisdom. The vajra is most often depicted
with a cluster of five prongs at either end of its central
lotus-topped hub (stylized representation: Fig.1a), but
single-pointed, three-pointed and
also occur as Vajrayāna ritual implements.
The vajra is said to measure twelve units in length, as
it eliminates the twelve links in the chain of Dependent
Arising. Its rounded central hub
(chos-rid), or 'the sphere of actual reality', the ultimate
truth of Emptiness. On either side of the central hub are
three ascending rings, symbolizing Emptiness, Sign-
lessness and Wishlessness. Above these rings on either
side are two eight-petaled lotuses. The eight upper lo-
tus petals represent the eight great
great male Bodhisattvas,
and the
eight
petals their female counterparts.
Collectively the sixteen lotus petals symbolize the six-
teen kinds of Emptiness (sanyata) that are listed in the
Mahāyāna sutras. Above each of
f these
lotuses is a fur-
ther set of three rings, which collectively symbolize
the six Perfections of a Bodhisattva-Giving, Moral-
ity, Patience, Energy, Concentration and Wisdom. The
upper ring is capped with a flat, circular moon disk,
which creates the form of a lotus throne on either side
of the central hub. These two moon disks symbolize
the union of absolute and relative truth. From the cen-
ters of the moon disks rise symmetrically the vajra's
square-sectioned central prongs, pointed spikes simi-
lar to a sword or spear-head. The single-pointed vajra
appears in this form (Fig. 1b) with its two sharp spikes
representing the central channel as the axis of Mount
Meru.
The three-pointed mujra has two curved side prongs
which unite with the central prong below its tip, and
which emanate from the mouths of makaras or water-
monsters (71) as 'vira-tongues'. Its three prongs sym-
bolize the three main psychic channels or nadr, the three
times (past, present and future); the three realms (be-
low,on and above ground); the destruction of the three
poisons (greed, hate and delusion); the three kāyas or
'Bodies' of the Buddha; and the 'three gates' of body,
speech and mind.
The five-pointed vajra has a central prong and four
curved outer prongs positioned in the cardinal di-
rections, which similarly emerge from the mouths of
makaras. These four makaras symbolize the four im-
measurables (compassion, love, sympathetic joy, and
equanimity); the four gateways to Liberation (medi-
tations on Emptiness, Signlessness, Wishlessness, and
Noncomposition); the conquest of the four Māras; the
four activities (calming, increasing, subjugating and
destroying);
the four directions, and the four purified
elements of earth, water, fire and air. Collectively the
five upper prongs represent the enlightened qualities of
the Five Buddha Families, and the lower
prongs their
five female consorts—symbolizing the elimination of
the five poisons (greed, hate, delusion, pride and jeal-
the five aggregates (skandha) of the person-
ality. Here the four outer prongs curve inwards to unite
with the central
central prong-signifying that the four aggre-
gates of form, feeling, perception and volition depend
upon the fifth aggregate, consciousness. Collectively
the ten
ten Perfections, and the ten stages or 'grounds' (bham)
prongs also symbolize the ten directions, the
of the Bodhisattva Path.
The nine-pointed vajra (Fig. 10)-with a central
prong and eight directional prongs--represents the
union of the Five Buddhas and the Four Mothers' or
consorts of the four cardinal Buddhas (east, south, west
and north). The nine points also symbolize Vajradhara
surrounded by
the eight Bodhisattvas, and the nine
"vehicles' (vāna) of the Buddhist Path.
The nine-pointed vajra is commonly depicted in Ti-
betan art as a five-pointed vajra, but with open prongs
that do not unite with the central prong (Fig. 1d). A
visual distinction is also made between a peaceful vajra

or scepter with uniting prongs, and a wrathful ojra or
indestructible weapon with open prongs. Iconograph-
ically the vajra as an attribute is usually depicted in a
simplified form, owing to small scale, and is most often
colored as a golden scepter, or as a dark blue weapon
made of meteorite iron.
2. The crossed vajra (viśva-vajra; rdo-rje rgya-
gram)
The crossed or 'universal' vajra-formed from four
lotus-mounted vajra-heads, which emanate from its
central hub to the four directions- symbolizes the prin-
ciple of absolute stability. In the cosmographic descrip-
tion of Mount Meru a huge vison-wajra supports or un-
derlies the entire physical universe. Similarly in the
representation of the mandala, a vast, flat visom-iwjm ap-
pears as the immovable support of the mandala palace.
many visualization practices a vista-zajra is either
drawn or imagined underneath the practitioner's med-
itation seat, and bronze-cast statues of deities are com-
monly sealed at their base with a metal plate inscribed
with a visua-vajra.
The hub of
of the višra-vajra is usually colored dark
blue, with the four directional mira-heads colored
white (E), yellow (S), red (w), and green (N), corre-
sponding to the placement and qualities of the Five
Buddhas, the five elements and so forth. Collectively
the number of prongs of a visva-vajra may number
twelve, twenty or thirty-six, depending on whether
three, five or nine prongs are depicted upon each cujra-
head. Twelve prongs symbolize the purification of the
twelve links of Dependent Arising; twenty prongs, the
purification of the twenty deluded views; and thirty-
six prongs along with the central hub, the thirty-seven
aids to Enlightenment
3. The bell (ghantā, dril-hu)
The ritual hand-bell, representing the feminine princi-
ple of Wisdom, is normally held in the left, 'Wisdom'
hand. It is usually paired with the male vajra-held
in the right, 'Method' hand-as the two main ritual
implements symbolizing the Perfections of Wisdom or
(va-
jra). The vajra is a symbol of form, and the bell a symbol
of Emptiness, whose intangible ring is said to 'proclaim
the sound of Emptiness'. The ritual set of a uwjra and
bell essentially represents the Yidam or tutelary de-
ity and the deity's mandala with the bell symbolizing
the latter from its base upwards. The open mouth or
rim of the bell represents the mandala's disk of space.
Above the rim is an embossed ring of upright vajras
enclosed between two rows of pearls. The lower row
of pearls represents the outer guardian circle of five-
colored flames that surrounds the mandala; the ring of
sixteen, twenty-four or thirty-two vajras represents the
mandala's vajra wall; and the upper row of pearls rep-
resents the thirty-two or sixty-four petals of the 'lotus-
womb' circle. Above these three rows is an undeco
rated area, representing the earth disk of the mandala.
Above the open earth disk area is a frieze of eight faces
of glory' (kirtimukha), with strings of pearls and jew-
els hanging from their ferocious mouths. The eight
kirtimukha faces represent the eight makara heads of the
vast visua-ujra that supports the mandala palace, and
the nets of hanging jewels represent the decorations
upon the palace's outer walls. Between the kirtimukha
faces and within the ares of the jewel nets may appear
the symbols of the eight Bodhisattvas, a ujra, wheel,
jewel, lotus, sword and so forth. Above the kirtimukha
faces are two further rows of pearls enclosing a ring of
mujras. The pearls represent the decorations upon the
palace's inner walls, and the horizontal wjra circle the
eight or sixteen Emptinesses (fanyata). On the upper
shoulder of the bell's casing is an eight-petaled lotus
inscribed with eight syllables. The lotus petals rep-
resent the eight male Bodhisattvas, and the syllables
the eight female Bodhisattvas. At the top of the bell's
casing is an inner lotus circle from which the metal
stem of the bell rises. This is the lotus-throne of the
mandala's central deity, which in the case of the bell
is the goddess Prajñā-pāramitā, 'the Perfection of Wis-
dom'. Above the stem's base is a long-life vase full of
nectar (> 60), which betokens Prajñā-pāramita's Body
as the 'nectar of accomplishment'. Above the vase rises
Prajñā-pāramitā's head, sealed above her jeweled tiara
with a five-pointed vajra.

4. The ritual dagger (kila; phur-pa)
The triple-bladed dagger essentially symbolizes the
wrathful Buddha-activity of the deity Vajrakila. The
Sanskrit term kila means a spike or nail, and the com-
mon meaning of the Tibetan word phur-pa is a tethering
stake or tent-peg. As a ritual dagger it is usually made
of iron, although specific woods are prescribed for cer-
tain rituals. Its three-sided blade symbolizes the over-
coming of the three poisons of greed, hate and delusion.
The top of the blade issues from the mouth of a makara
as a 'ferocious striker', and descending from the makara-
head within the recesses of the three blades are pairs of
coiling någa-serpents. The makara symbolizes the fero-
cious power of the krla, and the six serpents represent
the six Perfections. The handle of the kila is an eight-

sided shaft with knots at either end. Various symbolic
interpretations are given for these components, such
as: the Noble Eightfold Path; the eight great charnel
grounds of the eight directions; or the eight psychic
channels (nädi) that emanate from the heart cakra and
are scaled by constricting knots. The shaft and its two
knots
Is may also symbolize the three heavens, of the de-
sire gods, the form gods and the formless gods. The top
of the kila is usually crowned with three heads of wrath-
ful deities, which in paintings are colored white, blue
the deity Yamantaka, who represents the aspect of Body
and the destruction of hatred; the blue, central face is
that of Amſta-kundalin, who represents the aspect of
Mind and the destruction of delusion; and the red, left
face is that of Hayagriva, who represents the aspect of
Speech and the destruction of greed. The combined
skull-crowns of these three heads create a circular tiara
of twelve skulls, which represents the overcoming of
the twelve links in the chain of Dependent Arising. Sur-
mounting this tiara is a central topknot formed from the
bound hair of the three deities. This may be crowned
by a half-vajra, or be unadomed, serving as a flattened
head for the symbolic activity of hammering the kila
into the effigy of a malignant
In its most complex representational form as the
deity Vajrakila, the handle of the ritual dagger takes
his form with six arms and three heads, with the
triple-sided blade forming his dagger-shaped lower
body. But in painted images, the kila as a hand-held
implement is usually portrayed in a simplified version
of the form described above.
Some ritual daggers are crowned by a single or triple
horse's head, representing the deity Hayagriva.

or balanced upon the left shoulder, where it symbol-
izes the male partner as Method'. As an attribute
of the goddess Vajra-yogini it represents her consort
Cakra-sambara, and its components symbolize the
sixty-two deities of Cakra-sambara's mandala. A yo-
gint's khatrvīnga is equal in length to her height, but as
a hand-held implement of multiple-armed deities or
seated
I figures the khattringa is generally shown shorter
for aesthetic reasons.
In its
its outer symbolism the khatvānga represents the
physical universe of Mount Meru; with the crossed -
jro, vase, red severed head, green decaying head and
white skull symbolizing the element disks of earth, wa-
ter, fire, air and space. The crossed mujra represents
the earth base of Mount Meru, and its twelve visible
prongs the surrounding continents and subcontinents.
The vase represents Mount Meru with its open top rep.
resenting Indra's palace. The freshly severed, red head
above the vase symbolizes the six heavens of the desire
gods (kämávacara-dewa); the blue or green decaying head
symbolizes the eighteen heavens of the desireless form
gods (rapdeacara-dema); the dry white skull symbolizes
the four highest realms of the formless gods (arīlpáva -
cara-deva); and the crowning vajra symbolizes the par-
adise realms of the Buddhas. The flowing, white silk
ribbon represents the great salt ocean; the triple ban-
derole represents the victory banner on Mount Meru's
summit; the sun and moon emblems represent these
planets circling Mount Meru's summit; and the damaru
and bell symbolize the union of Method and Wisdom.
In its inner symbolism the white, eight-sided shaft
represents the purity of the Buddha's Noble Eightfold
Path. The crossed vajra-usually depicted in half-
section-represents the four purified elements, the four
activities and the four gateways to Liberation (>1). The
small golden vase full of anerta symbolizes the nectar of
attainment'-the non-conceptual awareness that mind
is identified with the Perfection of Wisdom (prajña-
paramita). The billowing, white silk ribbon represents
the various Buddhist teachings adapted to the needs
of different
The triple banderole, colored
yellow, red and blue, represents the union of the three
Vehicles, Hinayāna, Mahayana and-Vajrayana. The
hanging damaru and bell the teachings of
Method and Wisdom, and the auspicious conjunction
of the moon and sun signifies the realization of Method
and Wisdom. The union of the damaru, bell and triple
banderole also represents the purity of Body, Speech
and Mind.
The three impaled heads represent the three kayas.
The nirmana-kaya is represented by the freshly severed
disciples.
5. The tantric staff or khatvärga (kha-tudm-ga)
The khatranga-literally, 'the leg (anga) of a cot-bed
(khatua) —is one of the most complex iconographic
symbols of Vajrayāna Buddhism. It consists of a long,
eight-sided, white sandalwood shaft, which is sealed
at its base with a half-vajra, and crowned at its top with
a crossed vajra, a golden vase, two severed heads and a
dry skull, and at the summit a vajra or a flaming trident.
From the crossed vajra and vase hang a long silk ribbon
and usually one or two hanging threads, which bear the
emblems of a sun and moon, a triple banderole, and a
damaru and bell.
The khatvānga is one of the main attributes of tantric
yogins and yoginis. When carried by female deities it
is usually held in the crook of the left, 'Wisdom' arm

Great Bliss. The eight-sided, white sandalwood shaft
symbolizes the mandala's guardian circle of the eight
great charnel grounds; and the half-zajra at the shaft's
base represents the vajra-tent guardian circle that sur-
rounds the eight charnel grounds.
Certain deities hold special variants of the
khalinga's standard form described above. For exam-
ple: the shaft may be of red sandalwood; the hanging
ornaments and silk ribbon may not be depicted, or the
entire khanga may be of bone, with three white skulls

head, the sambhoga-kaya by the decaying head, and
the dharma-kaya by the dry white skull. They also
symbolize the three gateways to Liberation: Emptiness
of cause (red head), effect (green head), and phenomena
(white skull). In reverse order-white, red, and blue
or green they denote the aspects of Body, Speech and
Mind, with the dry skull as the white syllable om at the
crown (Body), the decaying head as the red syllable A
at the throat (Speech), and the freshly severed head as
the blue syllable Hum at the heart (Mind). The half-
vainas at the bottom and top of the khatpariga symbolize
the indistinguishable perfection of the five Buddha
Wisdoms, and the unity of the five kāyas of the Highest
Yoga Tantras. When a trident crowns the top of the
khatranga it symbolizes the Three Jewels, the Buddhas
of the three times, and victory over the three realms
(below, upon and above the earth).
On a deeper esoteric level the trident represents the
union of the three main psychic channels or nādi, with
the flaming central prong symbolizing the ascent of
the inner fire (candalı; gtum-mo) through the central
channel. The white, eight-sided shaft symbolizes the
central channel flooded with white bodhicitta from the
melting of the drops at the crown cakra (white skull),
and the shaft's eight sides represent the eight nādi
emanating from the heart cakra. The five ascending
ients are represented by the crossed cujm (earth);
the vase of nectar (water); the red head (fire); the
green head (air); and the white skull (space). The
half-vajra above the skull represents Wisdom as the
sixth element. The hanging symbols of the moon
and sun conjunction represents the union of Method
and Wisdom, as the united energies of the lunar and
solar channels entering, abiding and dissolving into the
central channel. The pairing of the sounding damaru
and bell represents Method and Wisdom as the union
of Great Bliss and Emptiness; and the billowing, white
silk ribbon represents the melting and descent of the
white bodhicitta drops, which flood the yogin's body
with the
e experience of Innate Great Bliss.
On a secret level the khatoanga represents the sixty-
two-deity mandala of Cakra-sambara; with the golden
vase representing Cakra-sambara's palace, and its con-
tained amrta the deity himself as the essence of Great
Bliss (maka-sukha). The crossed zajra represents the
eight deities of the mandala's Pledge Circle; the lower,
blue head the sixteen blue deities of the Mind Circle; the
middle, red head the sixteen red deities of the Speech
Circle; the white skull the sixteen white deities of the
Body Circle; and the crowning five-pronged vajra the
four surrounding directional deities of the Circle of

6. The hand-drum or damaru (da-ma-ru, ma-
chun)
The double-sided tantric hand-drum or damaru is held
and played in the right, male or 'Method' hand by both
male and female deities or tantric practitioners. Its
function is to invoke all Buddhas, inspiring them with
supreme joy. The 'male' damaru proclaims the sound of
Great Bliss', and is frequently paired with the bell held
in the left, 'female' hand, which proclaims the 'sound
of Emptiness'. The tantric damaru (Fig. 6a) is described
as being fashioned from the joined craniums of an
lescent boy and girl, whose skulls 'sounding together
sexually symbolize the union of absolute and relative
bodhicifta. The two skin drumheads of the damaru are
most often of goatskin dyed or painted green, but on
small damarus snakeskin or fishskin
may be used. The
central waist of the damaru is bound with an ornate
band from which a long, silk-valanced 'tail' hangs, em-
bellished with jewels and hanging tassels. On either
side of the central waist hang two threads which carry
the padded or crocheted strikers that sound the beating
of the damaru when it is rapidly rotated back
and forth in the upraised right hand. The damaru may
also be made of turned or carved wood and frequently
has mantras painted on its inner surface.
A variation of the damaru is found in the hourglass-
shaped Saivite 'monkey drum' (Tib. cante'u; Fig. 6b).
This wood-turned drum is tensioned by a zig-zag cord
threaded between the drumskins, such that its pitch
may be raised by squeezing upon the lattice of strings
A type of large wooden damaru is employed in
the 'cutting' ritual—the Tibetan practice of good. This
drum (good-rra; Fig. 6c), which typically measures
between twelve and sixteen inches in diameter, is said
to proclaim the 'sound of impermanence, and is often
decorated on its wooden sides with miniature paintings
of the eight forms of Padma-sambhava or of the eight

at its waist

navel-represents Emptiness as the red, female bodhi-
citta. Esoterically the skull-cup of blood represents the
Mind of the deity (white skull) being filled with Great
Bliss (red blood); and on a deeper level the arising of
the Illusory Body (white skull) from the state of Clear
Light (red blood).
For wrathful male deities, such as Mahākåla, the
pairing of the curved knife and skull-cup represents
the union of Method and Wisdom. For wrathful god-
desses this polarity symbolism is often reversed with
the curved knife representing the Wisdom that severs
all conceptualizations, and the skull-cup representing
Method as the preservation of bliss' (white bodhicitta).
Certain traditions also maintain that the skull-cups held
by male deities are old or dry skulls, and those held by
female deities are fresh or wet skulls. The blood within
the skull-cup is said to swirl in a clockwise direction for
Father tantra' practices, and in an anticlockwise direc-
tion for ‘Mother tantra' practices. The cranial fissures
of a skull-cup often divide the skull into five sections,
symbolizing the unified Wisdoms of the Five Buddha
Families.

7. The thighbone trumpet (rkan-glin)
The thighbone trumpet-fashioned from a human fe-
mur as a bored horn-is said to produce a sound that is
pleasing to the wrathful deities, but terrifying to all evil
spirits. It is usually held as a left-hand, Wisdom' at-
tribute of yogins, yogints and siddhas, particularly those
associated with the good lineage or with an affinity to the
charnel grounds. It is also employed in rituals of exor-
cism and controlling the weather by Tibetan shamans.
In the tantric tradition the left femur of a sixteen-year-
old brahmin girl was considered to be most effective for
controlling spirits; next most effective was the right fe-
mur of a sixteen-year-old male brahmin boy, followed
by the femur of a murder victim, then of a
a person who
had died from a weapon or a sudden accidental death,
then of a person who had died from a virulent or con-
tagious disease. The femur of a person who had died
from old age or natural causes was considered virtually
powerless for spirit subjugation. The femur of a tiger
(Tib. stag-glin) was also used as a thighbone trumpet, as
it was believed to embody the ferocious power of this
animal.
>> trumpet, thighbone.
8. The skull-cup (kapala; thod-pa, ka-pa-la, ban-
dha)
The skull-cup, a bowl made from a human cranium,
serves as an offering, eating or libation vessel for a
large number of Vajrayāna deities. It is commonly
held in the left hand of siddhas, dakinis, Yidams and
protective deities, containing such substances as the
blood, marrow, intestines, fat, brains and hearts of en-
emies, personified as rudras and māras. The qualities
attributed to the differing sources
of human bone uti-
lized for skull-cups follow the same sequence as for the
thighbone trumpet described above, with the skull of a
brahmin or a victim of murder or execution being the
most effective. The 'misbegotten skull' (lib. nal-thod)
of a seven- or eight-year-old child born from an inces-
tuous union is also considered to be extremely effective
in certain tantric rituals.
The skull-cup is most often held in the left, Wisdom
hand, frequently at the level the heart, where it may
be paired with right-hand, 'Method' attributes, such
as the curved knife or vajra. The white bone of the
skull-derived from the 'male' crown of the head-
represents form as the white, male bodhicitta; and its
content of warm red blood-derived from the
9. The curved knife (kartri, kartari, gri-gug)
The vajra-sealed, curved flaying knife, held in the right
hands of goddesses, is known as the 'knife of the
däkinis'. It consists of a flat, sharpened iron blade
often with a curved hook at its outer extremity—which
combines the
e flaying a
g activities of cutting, scraping and
pulling. Its faceted or eight-sided handle is attached
to the top of the blade by either a leaf-shaped golden
mount or the head of a makaro, and the handle's
is sealed by a half-vajra. The dūkinis 'ferociously circle
s top
the knife in the ten directions', overcoming all nega-
tive forces, the knife being the Wisdom consciousness
that severs all emotional defilements and conceptual-
izations. The sharp edge of the blade cuts through the
twoʻveils' or obscurations (Sktīvarana; Glossary: ob-
scurations). In the hands of female deities the curved
knife thus represents Wisdom, and is usually paired
with the skull-cup representing Method (Fig. 9a).
In the hands of wrathful male Yidam and protective
deities this polarity symbolism is reversed, with the
knife representing Method and the skull-cup
Here the knife could be described as a 'chopper' and
occurs in two distinct forms: either as the hooked
dakini's knife, or as a semi-circular, crescent-shaped
blade which may emanate flames along its edge (Fig.
9b). In the iconography of wrathful deities such as
Mahäkäla, the chopper is often held in the right hand

hearts, lungs, intestines and marrow of these enemies

10. The bow (dhanus, capa; gzu) and arrow
(sara, bana; mda)
The wooden or bamboo bow, generally shaped like the
classical Greek bow of Cupid, is naturally held in the
left, 'Wisdom' hand, and is usually paired with the ar-
row held in the right, 'Method' hand (Fig. 10a). As
symbols of Wisdom and Method their pairing symbol-
izes that the Wisdom of the bow 'projects' Method or
skilful means as the arrow; or that the Perfection of
Wisdom 'launches' the other five Perfections-Giving,
Morality, Patience, Energy and Concentration which
make up Method. When an undrawn bow and arrow
are held together in the left hand they symbolize the
coincidence of Wisdom and Method, or the union of
Wisdom and concentration. When the arrow is notched
and the bowstring drawn ready for shooting (Fig. 10b),
the bow may symbolize the deity's triumph over the
three realms, and the arrow the transfixing of false
views, such as superstition and conceptual thought.
When the arrow is aimed precisely at the heart of an
it may symbolize the concentrated and spon-
taneous activity of Wisdom and compassion directed
towards the realization of the dharma-kaya (symbolized
by the enemy's heart).
A bow of black iron is borne by the wrathful deity,
Eunuch 'Traksad Mahākäla.
The Tibetan arrow has a variety of names and forms,
such as the bamboo arrow (myug-mdo'); the iron arrow
(lcogs-mda'); the poison-tipped arrow (dug-mda'); the
long arrow (mda-chen); the magical arrow (thun-mda");
the fire-arrow (me'i mda); the flower arrow (me-tog-xi
ventional bamboo arrow has three smoothed bamboo
joints, three steering-feathers from a vulture or eagle,
a sharp iron tip, and a notched end bound with five-
colored silk thread. The arrow's straight shaft repre-
sents the central channel and the three smooth joints
the untying of the psychic knots that constrict it. The
three steering-feathers represent the union of the three
kāyas as Body, Speech and Mind, and triumph over
the three realms, poisons and times. The arrowhead
symbolizes Wisdom as penetrative ess; the five-
11. The arrow-banner (mda'-dar)
The arrow-banner, a bunch of silk ribbons tied to an
arrow, is used in arrow-divination (mda'-mo) and a wide
variety of Vajrayāna rituals. The arrow is normally
planted upright in a container of grain or auspicious
substances, or if hand-held, held vertically in the right
hand, head downwards. Its steering-feathers may be
derived from the wing feathers of particular birds, its
shaft may be of a certain wood or color, and its tip may
be of a certain metal. The silk ribbons, of five colors,
are tied on below the flight and hang down. A small,
silver divination mirror (mo'i me-lon) is usually fastened
to the knot. Divination dice or conch shells may also
be suspended from the mirror. The arrow-shaft, conch
and mirror represent the Body, Speech and Mind of the
deity respectively.
12. The fire-arrow (agni-bana; me'i mda')
The fire-arrow was originally an incendiary arrow of
ancient Indian warfare, but later the term was also
applied to a launched missile or javelin propelled by
gunpowder. Kālacakra holds in one of his right hands
an attribute described either as a 'fire-arrow' or as 'three
arrows', and depicted as a flaming arrow or a trinity of
arrows. When the Kalacakra-tantra was introduced into
Tibet in 1024 CE, the Chinese had already been using
gunpowder in guns for over a century, so Kālacakra's
fire-arrow may possibly be
gunpowder-driven
13. The leopard-skin bow-case (gzig-subs) and
tiger-skin quiver (stag-ral)
The bow is often sheathed in a leopard-skin bow case
hung across the shoulder or waist of the deity, and cou-
pled with a tiger-skin quiver of arrows. The womb-
or vagina-shaped spots of the leopard symbolize the
feminine principle of Wisdom, and the phallic-shaped
stripes of the tiger symbolize the male principle of
Method or skilful means. Leopard and tiger-skin loin-
cloths are worn by wrathful female dakints and male
heruka deities respectively.

14. The flower bow (puspa-dhanus; me-tog-gi
głu) and flower arrow (puspa-sara; me-tog-gi

The bow and arrow made of flowers were originally
attributes of the Hin god of love, Kāma-deva, whose

five arrows of passion were fashioned from the flow-
ers of the white lotus, red asoka, mango tree, white
jasmine, and blue upala lotus. These attributes were
absorbed into Vajrayana Buddhism as the weapons of
the subjugating goddesses Kurukulla and Red Tärā.
The four-armed form of Kurukulla holds a drawn bow
and arrow, and a hook and noose made out of nectar-
laden, red utpala flowers. These attributes characterize
her activities of bewitching and enchanting through her
seductive magnetism, just as bees are drawn and intox-
icated by the nectar of flowers. Kamadeva is shown,

and five arrows, being trampled upon by the Buddhist
deities Kurukulla and Kālacakra.

17. The scorpion (urścika; sdig-pa)
The black Indian scorpion (Fig. 17 a) is a potent symbol
of destructive malice, its scaled body sections, armored
pincers and whip-like, poisonous sting marking one of
nature's most formidable and frightening aggressors.
In the iconography of the various classes of spirits, the
form of the scorpion is used to denote demons of plague
and pestilence. Within the early Nyingma tradition of
Tibetan Buddhism it was identified as a symbol of the
Vajraktlo-tantra transmissions, its poisonous red sting
representing the bloodied or poisoned tip of the ritual
dagger (kilo). In rituals of destructive activity the image
of a scorpion-frequently with nine heads, eighteen
pincers, and twenty-seven eyes (Fig. 17 b) is often
drawn to represent the malevolent form of an evil spirit.
As a left-hand attribute the black scorpion is held by
several of the wrathful manifestations of Padma-sam-
bhava.
(No Glossary entry)
15. The sword (asi, khadga; ral-gri)
The sword is primarily a symbol of Wisdom, or the
discriminating awareness that cuts through the veil of
ignorance and obscurations. As one of the two main
emblems of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, Manjuśrī, the
flaming sword is held aloft in his right hand and paired
with the text of the Perfection of Wisdom Satra (Prajña-
pāramita-sutra), which rests upon a lotus blossom held
in his left hand. The emblems of a sword and book are
borne by many of the human emanations of Manjusri,
such as Trisong Detsen, Sakya Pandita, Tsongkhapa,
and Longchenpa. The Wisdom sword of victory is also
a right-hand attribute of many Yidam and wrathful
deities, where it functions as a weapon to destroy all
hindering demons and enemies. The double-edged
blade symbolizes the unity of absolute and relative
truth; its sharp point the Perfection of Wisdom; and its
fiery majra-flames the blazing of the wisdom-awareness
fire.

18. The knife with wavy blade (churika; chu-
gri)
The wavy-bladed fish-knife called 'water-knife' in Ti-
betan-is a hand-held implement certain wrathful
deities and derives from the fisherman's knife of India,
which is used to scale, gut and fillet fishes. The wave-
shaped blade of this knife emanates as a tongue from a
makara head, which adorns its vajra-sealed handle. The
fish-knife symbolizes the severing of cyclic existence
(samsara), cutting away the guts (emptiness of inher-
ent existence), scales (phenomenal appearances), heads
(cycle of birth and rebirth), and tails (karmic propensi-
ties) of sentient beings.
19. The razor (kşura; spu-gri)
The razor was one of the few material possessions that
an ordained Buddhist monk was permitted to carry,
and was used to shave the head and facial hair. As
a weapon it is wielded in the right hands of certain
wrathful deities, and symbolizes the 'shaving away' of
defilements and evil karma. It is depicted in a similar
form to the fish-knife, but usually has a shorter and
straighter blade.

16. The scorpion-hilted sword (ral-gri sdig-pa'i
yu-ba-can)
The handle of the scorpion-hilted sword is shaped as
the black body and tail of a scorpion, with its pin-
cers forming the hilt, and the flame-tipped blade pro-
truding as a long iron tongue from its mouth. As a
wrathful weapon this sword is wielded by deities as-
sociated with pestilence or plague, such as the wrath-
ful goddesses Ekajați and, in her form as goddess of
plagues, Remati. The protective warrior-deity, B'ektse,
also wields the scorpion-hilted sword, representing his
destructive activities of spreading disease and pesti-
lence upon the battlefield.
20. The dart (bhindipāla) and sakti dagger
(sakti)
The triangular iron dart with a flight of three peacock
feathers (Fig. 20a) is a right-hand attribute of Vajra-
bhairava. The three sides of its kila-shaped blade sym-
bolize the destruction of the three primary poisons of

greed, hate and delusion, and the three peacock feath-
ers represent Vajra-bhairava's victory over the three
realms. The union of the blade and feathers also sym-
bolizes the purification of conceptualizations of subject
and object.
Sri-devr as Tsomo Remati holds in her right hand
a similar weapon, the small, peacock-feathered dagger
known as a Sakti (sak-ti, mdun-thun; Fig. 20b), which
likewise symbolizes her triumph over the three poisons
(triple blade) and the three realms (three peacock eyes).
The Sanskrit term bhindipala refers to a short javelin
or pointed missile, and in Vajra-bhairava's iconogra-
phy is sometimes identified with the conical, peacock-
feather sprinkler used in ritual (Fig. 59c).
dart; sakti dagger.
As a Buddhist weapon the trident primarily symbol-
izes the destruction of the three poisons, with primor-
dial ignorance being transmuted into the wisdom-fire
of the central prong. The three points also symbolize
victory over the three realms; transcendence over the
three times; the three kāyas; the unity of Body, Speech
and Mind; the triumph of the Buddhas of the three
times; the Mahāyāna trinity of Buddha, Dharma and
Sangha; and the Vajrayana trinity of Guru, Yidam and
Dakini. Esoterically the trident's shaft represents the
central channel; the two side prongs represent the uni-
fied energies of the solar and lunar channels; the dry
white skull symbolizes the descent of the white bodhi-
citta; and the red yaktail pennon the ascent of the red
bodhicitta.

21. The sickle (dgra-zor)
The sickle or scythe symbolizes the cutting away of all
evil karmas, 'overturning the world above the ground'
in the karmic process of reaping, in contrast to the plow-
share which 'overturns the world below the ground' in
the process of sowing. The sickle has a sharply-hooked
iron blade and is mounted in a golden handle, often
with makara and vara embellishments.

23. The serpent-trident (sbrul-gyi rtse-gsum)
The serpent-entwined trident or caduceus was origi-
nally an emblem of Siva, as Lokešvara, 'Lord of the
World', and was adopted into Mahāyāna Buddhism as
an emblem of the Bodhisattva Avalokita in his form as
Simha-näda, the 'Lion's Roar'. Esoterically the shaft
of the caduceus symbolizes the central channel, and
the two entwined serpents (which may be colored red
and white) symbolize the coiling of the solar and lunar
channels around the central channel. Simha-näda's ca-
duceus is, however, described in his sadhana (437) as
a green trident encircled by a single white snake with
blood dripping from its mouth.
trident (with snake).
24b
22. The trident (trisala; rtse-gsum, tri-su-la)
The trident, literally 'three teeth', is known in Sanskrit
as tri-sala, meaning 'three spikes or points'. The tri-
dent may be identified as a trident ensign (ru-mtshon
rtse-gsuni), trident spear (mdur rtse-gsum), trident staff
(dbyu-gu rtse-gsum), or trident hatvārga (kha-twim ga
rise-gsum). The trident ensign commonly bears a flag:
the trident spear and staff are identical in appearance,
taking the form of a trident mounted on a long wooden
shaft, which may also bear the emblems of a dry skull,
yaktail pendant, or silk ribbons. The trident khatrrānga
may be depicted either as a full khaturīga, or in a more
simplified form as a severed-head or skull-mounted
trident.
The trident is an ancient symbol common to many
cultures. As a fish spear it identified the aquatic Greek
and Roman gods, Poseidon and Neptune. In Hinduism
the trident is a symbol of Siva, representing his tran-
scendence over the three qualities (guna) of nature (dy-
namic, pure and inert); creation, preservation and de-
struction as the three gods Brahmā, Vişnu and Siva;
and the three vibrational sounds, A-U-M, of the sacred
syllable om. Esoterically the three points represent the
three main psychic channels, and the flaming central
point represents the inner fire ascending through the
central channel
24. The spear, spear-flag, javelin and harpoon
The spear (kunta; mdui), consisting of a long wooden
shaft with an iron head, is a right-hand weapon of many
wrathful deities and essentially symbolizes the piercing
or impaling of all false notions and distorted views.
The spear-flag (mdun-dar; Fig. 24a), usually sur-
mounted by a red yaktail pennon with a billowing
triangular flag below its head, appears as the battle-
standard of Tibetan and Mongolian warfare, and is
often held by the indigenous warrior-deities of these
lands.
The javelin (Tomara; mda'-chen; Fig. 24b) or 'long
arrow is a hurled or thrown spear with a short bamboo
shaft.
The harpoon (ka-na-ya; Fig. 24c), with a retrieval
rope attached to its shaft, is a special form of spear held
by Vajra-bhairava and symbolizes the penetrating of
ignorance by discriminating awareness,

demons.

25. The club (danda, gada; dbyug-pa, be-com)
The club, as a weapon that pulverizes and crushes,
essentially symbolizes the annihilation of the veil of
ignorance and emotional defilements created by karma.
The tapering shaft of the club is usually (Fig. 25 a) of
red sandalwood or acacia wood, and is sealed at its
base with a small half-vnjra or jewel. A silk ribbon is
often looped around the upper shaft, and its top may
be crowned by a jewel, half-ajra or trident.
Specific deities hold clubs of a large variety of forms.
Some have a triangular-pointed kila blade on their base
(Fig. 25 b), whilst others have a square wooden section
with 'fortress gateways' along the shaft housing the
armies of the gods and asuras. The transverse wooden
club (Fig. 25c), held horizontally across the forearms of
Panjara Mahākāla, has several such fortress gateways
along its shaft, and is sealed at either end with a large
jewel encased in a golden makara-tail mount. This trans-
verse club is known as a 'magical wooden gong (phrul
gyi gande), and is derived from the monastic wooden
gong (gandn of early Indian Buddhism. This gong was
constructed from a plank of white sandalwood or de
odar, suspended by ropes or chains within a wooden
frame. It was struck to summon the Sangha to a reli-
gious discourse, and its sound was believed to terrify
the four Māras.
Another form of the corpse-club (ro-dbyug) is a hu-
man corpse impaled on a wooden stake (gsal-sin), usu-
ally through the anus (Fig. 26 d). Such horrific impale-
ment was practiced on the ancient Indian battlefield
and in the execution of hardened criminals. As a left-
hand, Wisdom'attribute of Vajra-bhairava the impaled
corpse symbolizes both the Emptiness of all phenom-
ena, and the power that the practice of this deity be-
stows upon the practitioner, no matter how great
his
accumulation of previous defilements may have been
On an inner level the penetration of the stake through
the anus and towards the crown symbolizes the central
channel.

27. The noose (paša; źngs-pa)
The rope noose or snare is normally held in the left,
'Wisdom' hand of certain deities, and may be paired
with the hook held in the right hand. The hand that
casts the noose usually makes the threatening Carjant
gesture, with the index finger raised and the rope coiled
round it (Fig. 27a). The two ends of the rope are
commonly sealed with a small hook and ring, or a half-
vajra and a hook or ring.
In its peaceful aspect the noose symbolizes the 'bind-
ing' of wisdom or awareness, and when coupled with
the hook represents the union of mindfulness with clear
understanding. In a more wrathful aspect it binds
the life vessels' (srog-rtsa) of
hindering demons.
Metaphorically it snares, binds and strangles the ego
-symbolizing the trainings in discipline, meditation
and wisdom respectively
The nooses of specific deities are described as be-
ing of leather, entrails, utpala flower roots, flowers (Fig.
27b), serpents, fire or lightning, and may also be spe-
cially colored.

26. The skull-club (thod-dbyug) and corpse-
club (zin-dbyug)
The skull-club (Fig. 26 ) is wielded in the right,
Method' hands of deities such as Yama, Yamāntaka
and Citipati. It symbolizes the destruction or death' of
karma, and the ultimate Emptiness of all phenomena.
As a weapon it terrifies all demons, and subjugates all
the vicious spirits of the three realms. Its basic form
is a small human skull mounted on a red sandalwood
shaft, which may be sealed at its crown and base with a
jewel or half-vajra and often has a billowing, white silk
ribbon knotted around its upper shaft.
A more funereal form is the skeleton-club (ker-rus-
kyi dhyug-pa; Fig. 26b), made from the skull, vertebrae,
rib-cage and pelvis of a human skeleton. The lower
handle of the skeleton-club may be formed from an
extension of the spinal vertebrae, or from the joined leg
bones of the stylized skeleton, which invariably lacks
The corpse-club (Fig. 26c), made from a stiff or
mummified human corpse, is wielded in the right
hand by deities such as Ekajați and Remati. With it
these plague-bestowing goddesses destroy the lives of
enemies harmful to the Buddhist teachings, displaying
28. The serpent noose (sbrul-sags)
The serpent noose is a left-hand attribute of deities such
as Rahula, Garuda, Sri-devi, and Virūpåkşa, the red
guardian king of the west. As a weapon the serpent
is depicted as a coiling green or black snake, which is
usually held in a closed fist with the forefinger raised in
the threatening turjant gesture. Śrī-devī, in her form as
the Self-arisen Queen, is described as wielding a black
serpent noose that trails for a length of 990 fathoms,
and binds all enemies and vow-breakers. Occasionally
the serpent that forms the noose is identified as one of
the great näga-kings, such as Vāsuki.

'dark blacksmith' deity, Damchen Dorje Lekpa, who
pulverizes vow-breakers with his mighty hammer, and
blows all evil dispositions into dust with the tiger-skin
bellows held in his left hand.

29. The chain (śrrikhala; laags-sgrog)
The iron chain or vajra fetters is an instrument of
subjugation, and often appears with the rope noose,
iron hook and ritual bell in a set of four attributes
employed in subjugating rites. As a weapon the chain
is held in one of the left, Wisdom' hands of Kāla-
cakra. The goddess Sri-devi wears broken iron fetters
around her ankles, symbolizing that she has broken the
twelve links in the chain of Dependent Arising, and has
abandoned the two extremes of samsira and Nirvana in
her unconditional freedom.
33. The shield (phalaka; phub)
The iron, wicker or rhinoceros-hide shield essentially
symbolizes the protection of the Buddhist teachings.
As a left-hand, 'Wisdom' weapon it is regularly paired
with the sword held in the right, Method' hand, repre-
senting the protection of all beings through the victori-
ous Wisdom and accomplishments of the Buddhas.
30. The hook or goad (ankuša; lcags-kyu)
The iron elephant-goad or vajra hook (Fig. 30 a) is gen-
erally paired with the rope noose as a weapon of subju-
gation, and symbolizes both the hooking of negativities
and the pulling or driving of all beings towards Liber-
ation. As an attribute of the elephant-driver or mahout
the hook is the implement that subjugates the 'wild
elephant' –a Buddhist metaphor for the untamed hu-
man mind. The iron hook is commonly wielded in the
right, 'Method' hand, with the index finger raised in
the threatening farjani gesture. In its more wrathful
depiction the hook may pierce the heart of an enem
whilst the noose binds the enemy's neck and limbs.
Subjugating deities such as Kurukullā may bear a
noose and hook made of utpala flowers (Fig. 30 b).

34. The eight-spoked wheel or discus (cakra;
'khor-lo)
The spiked iron wheel was employed as a hurled
weapon in ancient Indian warfare, and appears as
an attribute of the Hindu god Vişnu. Early Bud-
dhism adopted this symbol in eight-pointed form as
the Dharma-cakra, the emblem of the principle of abso-
lute non-violence (ahimsa). As both a peaceful attribute
and a wrathful weapon the eight-pointed cakra sym-
bolizes the Buddha's sovereignty throughout the eight
directions and the supremacy of his teachings upon the
Noble Eightfold Path.
The wrathful cakra may also be represented as a
six-pointed wheel, formed from the intersection of
two equilateral triangles, with a circular hole in its
center; in this form it resembles the 'throwing-star' of
recent 'Kung Fu' movie fame. A six or eight-pointed
cakra is also employed in the wrathful activities of
spirit subjugation or destruction, where the cakra may
serve as an 'iron prison' to restrain and disempower a
malevolent spirit

31. The axe (parašu, kutharika; dgra-sta, sta-re)
As a right-hand, 'Method' weapon the axe symbolizes
the severing of all negative notions and concepts from
the mind; it cuts through birth and death, root and
trunk. The Tibetan term for the axe, dgra-sta, means
enemy-axe”, implying that this weapon is used to
decapitate malignant demons or enemies. The axe
is depicted with a sharp, crescent-shaped, iron blade,
which is attached by leaf-shaped embellishments, or a
makara-head, to the central hub. This hub is normally
sealed with two vajra-heads at its top and back. The
tapering handle of the axe is usually of red sandalwood,
and often has a white silk ribbon tied upon its upper
shaft.
35. The Wheel of the Dharma (Dharma-cakra;
chos-kvi 'khor-lo)
The Dharma-cakra is an ancient Indian emblem of the
Cakravartin or 'universal monarch'. It was adopted
into early Buddhism as a symbol of the Buddha's
teachings upon the Eightfold Path of the Aryas-known
as his 'Turning the Wheel of the Dharma' It consists
of a central hub with three or four rotating, colored
segments, known as a 'whirl of joy" (dga'-"khyil), eight
radiating spokes enclosed within a circular rim, and an
outer, golden aureole embellished with jewels. It may
rest upon a lotus base, and its four directional segments
behind the eight spokes are normally colored to accord

The iron vajra-hammer' is a 'Method' weapon that
symbolizes the smashing of evil dispositions, especially
avarice, covetousness and miserliness. It may be paired

B. THE FIVE MAGICAL WEAPONS OF SRI-DEVI
36
Five special 'magical weapons' are borne by the 'Glori-
ous Goddess', Sri-devi (dPal-Idan lha-mo) or Remati, and
also occur as hand-held attributes of the many minor
deities and spirits who occur in her various retinues.
Four of these magical weapons (36-39) are suspended
from small serpents that adorn the saddle of her mule,
whilst the fifth (40) is tucked into the serpent girdle
round her waist.
38. The white and black spotted dice (so-rde'u
dkar-nag)
A pair of divination dice (Fig. 38 a) are threaded upon
a serpent-rope that hangs from the front of Śrī-devi's
saddle, and are commonly grouped with the bag of
diseases and the bundle of red curses (Fig. 38b). These
dice are colored white and black, with the white dice
marked with black dots positioned above, and the black
one with white dots below. With this divination dev
the
e goddess can determine the karmic outcome of any
situation. Often the white dice shows the highest 'six'
on its front face whilst the black dice displays the
lowest 'one', portraying the extremities of the scope
of her karmic judgement and retribution. Three dice
are usually employed rituals of divination, giving
a series of numerical prognostications between three
and eighteen, and sometimes three dice are depicted in
Sri-devi's iconography.

36. The bag of diseases (nad-kyi rkyal-pa)
The bag of diseases was probably an early Indian
weapon of germ warfare a skin bag of contagious dis-
eases could be catapulted into, or poison the water sup-
ply of, a besieged city. The bag itself consists of either
a flesh-colored, flayed skin or the green, decaying skin
of a human corpse, stuffed full of the body tissue and
vital organs of those who have died from the most viru-
lent of contagious diseases, such as the plague, dropsy,
leprosy, smallpox, blood fever, hepatitis, cholera and
dysentery. It is usually depicted as a small bulbous hu-
man skin, often with the boneless limbs knotted around
the neck and behind the torso, and with the pair of dice
suspended from a serpent coiled around the corpse's
neck. With this magical weapon the goddess spreads
a plague of diseases upon the demonic enemies of the
Buddha-dharma.

39. The ball of thread (mtshon-syi gru-gu)
A ball of variegated thread, plaited or twisted as a
cord of five colors, hangs from a serpent-rope at the
rear of Sri-devi's saddle. This ball is described as
embodying the essence of all wrathful weapons and
magical powers or spells. With this weapon Śrī-devī
binds all demonic enemies with invoked curses of
subjugation and destruction. Traditionally various
colored threads are used to protect against specific
forms of affliction, and a thread of five colors to protect
spirits. Śrī-devi's ball of thread may be
depicted in a number of different ways, such as a
wound ball of mixed colored threads, a ball with four
colored quadrants, or a series of concentric arcs colored
in three or four spiralling sections like a 'whirl of joy
(dga'-'khyil).

37. The bundle of red curses (byad-dmar gyi
khres-po)
With the bundle of red curses Sridevi casts binding
spells and inflicts deadly curses upon the enemies of
the Buddha-dharma. This magical weapon is most
often depicted as a rectangular Tibetan text that has
been dyed red on its paper edges and is sandwiched
between a pair of red wooden book covers. It may also
be wrapped within a red silk cloth and bound with a
red ribbon, or it may be depicted in the form of a group
of red scrolls.

Śrī-devi's fifth magical weapon, the cross-stick of
demons, is depicted as a long red sandalwood ba-
ton that is tucked into the serpent-girdle at her waist.
This 'tally-stick' or 'scored magical stick' (khrans-sit) is
marked with a number of notches or inscribed crosses
that are used to summon evil spirits. With this weapon
Sri-devi counteracts the curses of witchcraft inflicted
by malignant demons, and records the tally of punish-
ments due to oath-breakers and enemies of the Dharma.
The top of this tapering, red baton forms a rectangular
pyramid, and the notched designs upon its shaft may
be depicted as crossed or hatched designs in gold or
dark red, or as mystical insignia composed of geomet-
ric or intersecting lines.

41. The lotus (padma, kamala; pad-ma, che
skyes)
The Indian lotus, which grows from the watery mire but
is unstained by it, is a major Buddhist symbol of renun-
ciation, purity, and freedom from the faults of cyclic ex-
istence. As a hand-held attribute-often bearing within
its upper petals a specific ritual object or emblem of the
deity-the lotus is most frequently colored light red or
pink, with eight or sixteen petals. The stem of the lotus
often branches into three shoots, with a seed pod to one
side, the main blossom in the center, and a small, un-
opened bud to the other side representing the Buddhas
of the past, present and future. Lotus blossoms may
also be colored white, yellow, golden, blue and black.
The edible white lotus (pundarika; pad-ma dkar-po) is an
emblem of the Buddha Sikhin, and a sixteen-petaled
white utpala lotus is held by White Tārā, symbolizing
the perfection of her qualities. The yellow lotus (pad-ma
ser-po) and the golden lotus (gser-gyi pad-ma) are gener-
ally known as padma, and the more common red lotus
is usually identified as the kamala. The Sanskrit atpala is
specifically identified as the blue or black night lotus',
but its transliterated Tibetan equivalent (ut-pa-la) may
be applied to any color of lotus.
42. The book (pustaka; po-ti, glegs-bam)
Certain deities and historical teachers hold a religious
text, most often in the left hand, representing their Wis-
dom qualities and transmission of knowledge. The
text may be identified as the Perfection of Wisdom Satra
(Prajna-pāramita-stītra), supposed originally to have
been a hundred thousand slokas (3 200000 Sanskrit syl-
lables) long. As an emblem of the Dharma, the book
also represents the Speech aspect of the Buddha.
The emblems of a flaming Wisdom sword and the
text of the Prajna-pāramita-sūtra are held by the Bodhi-
sattva of Wisdom, Manjuśrī. These emblems are also
43. The rosary (mala; "phren-ba)
The Buddhist rosary--as a rule, of 108 identical beads
(Fig. 43 a)—is usually held in the right hand of deities
or eage
as to be used reciting mantras.
Alternatively, certain lineage teachers are represented
with the rosary coiled around their left or right wrist,
Specific kinds of beads are prescribed for the four
activities of tantra: with crystal, pearl, white lotus
seeds, conch shell or ivory beads used for peaceful
beads employed in rites of enrichment; red sandal-
rites, lotus seeds, bodhi seeds, gold, silver or bronze
wood, saffron-scented redwoods, coral and carnelian
employed in magnetizing, attracting or subjugating
rites; and rudraksa seeds, human or animal bone, iron
or lead beads used in rites of destructive activity. Ava-
lokita holds a rosary of white crystal; and certain wrath-
ful deities, such as Mahäkäla, hold a rosary of twenty-
one small human skulls (Fig. 43 b).

44. The almsbowl (patra; Thun-bzed)
The blue, iron almsbowl is generally held in the left,
Wisdom' hand of seated Buddha forms and of the Bud-
dha's disciples, the Sangha. This left hand is usually
held in the gesture of meditation, symbolizing both re-
nunciation and meditation upon Emptiness. The aper-
ture of the almsbowl is usually colored white, often
indicating milk or yogurt as the milk-rice meal that
Sākyamuni Buddha partook of prior to his Enlighten-
ment. Mount Meru may also be represented within
the central white aperture of the almsbowl, as may

45. The monk's staff (khakkhara; 'khar-gsil)
The mendicant's iron staff is commonly held in the
right hand by monastic disciples of the Buddha, and
may be paired with the almsbowl held in the left
hand as twin symbols of renunciation and meditation
upon Emptiness. Its complex form is said to embody
symbolically the thirty-seven aids to Enlightenment
(budkipaksa dharma). It has an upper frame in the shape
of a trefoiled oval of three arcs enclosing a
stap, with a second stapa forming the finial of the
staff. From the lower ares of the frame hang a series of
rattling, metal rings, with which the silent mendicant
could announce his presence and scare away animals
and reptiles from his path. Four iron rings are believed
to symbolize the Four Noble Truths of a humble bhiksu
or monk; six rings symbolize the six Perfections of a
Bodhisattva; eight rings symbolize the Noble Eightfold
Path followed by an Arhant; and twelve rings symbolize
the twelve deeds of the Buddha and his freedom from
the twelve links in the chain of Dependent Arising.

crowns the head of Maitreya. The stūpa is usually col-
ored white or golden, and may be supported on a lo-
tus base. Symbolically the stapa embodies a complex
iconographic meaning, with each its components

50. The fly-whisk (camara; rra-yab)
A white yaktail fly-whisk was an emblem of royalty in
ancient India, and was employed to fan the monarch
in the heat of
t of summer and to drive away flying insects,
such as flies, wasps and mosquitoes. Early Buddhism
adopted the fly-whisk or 'chowry' as an emblem of
Buddha's sovereignty and compassionate activity, and
along with the umbrella it occurs as one of the two main
symbols of protection. The white yaktail is usually
mounted in a golden jeweled handle, and is carried by
Arhants and celestial attendants of the Buddha.
51. The incense-burner or censer (spos-phor)
Burning incense, representing the faculty of smell, is
depicted as one of the five offerings of the senses, and is
an attribute of the offering goddess of incense, Dhüpā.
Powdered juniper (bsaris) is the main ingredient of
Tibetan incense, and it may be shown as stick incense
or as a powder smouldering in an incense-burner. This
incense-burner usually appears as a small, ornate metal
pot mounted upon a tripod of three short legs, and may
be suspended upon a swinging chain in the manner of a
Christian frankincense censer. As a hand-held attribute

54. The peacock-feathered umbrella (mäyüra-
chatra; rma-bya'i gdugs)
The umbrella or parasol made of peacock feathers is a
symbol of secular authority and is borne in religious
processions such as that of the Dalai Lama, where
religious authority is also represented by the white
or yellow silk umbrella. A peacock-feathered parasol
is displayed above the head of Sri-devi, symbolizing
the perfection of her activities in protecting all sentient
beings.

52. The lute (pi-wart) and viņā (gyud-mari)
The Central Asian or Chinese lute (ch'in) and the In-
dian vind are often interchangeably depicted in Tibetan
art, depending upon whether the imagery follows a
Chinese or an Indian style.
The Central Asian lute (Fig. 52 a) is the attribute of
the white guardian king of the east, Dhrtarästra, and
appear in the hands of celestial musicians or
gandharnas (dri-za). It is most often depicted in a similar
form to the Afghan rabab or modern Indian sarod:
with a goatskin-covered wooden soundbox, a tapering,
unfretted fingerboard, and an ornate upper peg-box
embellished with the carved head of a mythological
creature such as a dragon, garuda, or makara. The lute
usually has four five strings and a small bridge, and
is often depicted with its top edge forming a straight
line and its lower edge contoured in the traditional
shape of the instrument's body.
The vina (Fig. 52 b) is the main attribute of the god-
dess Sarasvati, and is also held by the offering goddess
of sound, Sabdavajrā, and the offering goddess of mu-
sic, Vīņādharā. Sarasvati's vina is usually depicted in
a form similar to the modern north Indian vicitra-vina,
comprising a long half-section of bamboo over which
the playing strings course, with two calabash resonat-
ing gourds fixed at either end below. The instrument
may also have a small soundbox at its bridge end and
a carved head surmounting its peg-box; these are often
shaped as the body and head of a swan, the vehicle of
the goddess Sarasvati.
53. The umbrella or parasol (chatra; gdugs)
As a traditional Indian symbol of royalty and protection
the shade of the parasol symbolizes protection from
the heat of suffering, illnesses, obstacles and harmful
forces. In ancient India thirteen umbrellas were carried
as a symbol of the king, and early Buddhism incorpo-
rated this number into the umbrella-wheels that crown
the Enlightenment stūpa of the Buddha. Iconographi-
cally, a domed, white silk umbrella, with a highly or-
nate frieze of silk valances, jeweled pendants, yaktails,
peacock feathers and silk ribbons, is often found above
the forms of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In Vajrayāna
Buddhism the attribute of a white umbrella was deified
as the goddess 'White Umbrella', Sitâtapatrā (@Dugs-
dkar).

55. Peacock feathers (näyüra-tilaka; rma-bya'i
mdons)
Traditionally the peacock is an enemy of poisonous
creatures, such as the snake and scorpion. The beautiful
electric blue of its neck and train plumage represents
the transmutation of this poison into the nectar of
Wisdom or accomplishment, A group of three hand-
held peacock feathers symbolizes the transmutation of
the three primary poisons of greed, hate and delusion,
and a group of five symbolizes the transmutation of the
five poisons of greed, hate, delusion, pride and jealousy
feather represents Wisdom, and the radiating golden
strands represent the myriad Methods or skilful means
of the Buddhas. Peacock feathers also adorn the flight
of the dart and sakti dagger (> 20), and the sprinkler
(kha-rgyan) of a flask (59).
53
56. The conch shell (sankha; dun)
The white, right-spiralling conch shell is an ancient
Indian attribute of the heroical gods, whose mighty
conch trumpets proclaimed their victory and accom-
plishments in war. Early Buddhism adopted the conch
as a symbol of the proclamation of the Buddha's teach-
ings, which fearlessly resounded throughout the ten
directions. Iconographically the Speech of the Buddha
is identified with this shell as the three conch-like cury-
ing lines depicted upon his throat. The natural conch
is usually found with its lipped opening to the left of
its spiralling end, but the rarer, right-spiralling white
conch shell (daksinävarta-Sankha; dun-dkar yyas-'khyil) is
considered most auspicious for ritual use. As a hand-
held attribute the conch is generally held in the left
hand of deities.

57. The mirror (darpana; me-lon)
The mirror is a perfect symbol of Emptiness or pure
consciousness. It is clear, bright and shining, it reflects
all of the objects of phenomenal appearance impartially,
and yet remains completely unaffected by the images
which arise in it-revealing all phenomena to be void
in essence. Iconographically the hand-held mirror is
usually depicted as a white or silver disk, which may
be surrounded by a golden aureole. It is often embel-
with five small circles inscribed at its center and
cardinal directions, symbolizing the transmutation of
all appearances into the Wisdoms of the Five Buddhas.
Certain deities hold a 'magical mirror' (phrul-gyi me-
lon), which reflects the karma of all beings throughout
the three realms and times. The mirror is also employed
in rituals of divination and is often depicted adorning
the knot of an arrow-banner (> 11). As an offering
the mirror represents both the faculty of sight and its
object, visible form.
58. The water-pot (kundikā, kamandalu; spyi-
blugs, ril-ba)
The water-pot is employed in rituals of ablution and
consecration, and symbolizes purification and the dis-
pensation of blessings as the 'water of life' or the 'nectar
of immortality' (amerta; bdud risi). In Indian iconog-
raphy the water-pot appeared as a simple, rounded
clay or bronze vessel, but in Tibetan iconography it is
most often depicted as a slender golden flask with a lid
and a pouring spout. The water-pot is an attribute of
Maitreya and the eight- and thousand-armed forms of
Avalokita.
A colored silk ribbon is usually tied around the neck of
the flask, representing one of the Five Buddha Families,
according to the Wisdom-activity of the ritual being
performed. For general or all-purpose ritual activity
a multicolored silk apron may be draped around the
neck of the flask (Fig. 59 b).
The consecrated water or 'nectar' (amyta; hdud-risi)
contained in the flask or vase is colored and scented
with saffron, and mixed with the 'five times five' or
twenty-five 'flask substances' (bum-dzas), consisting
of five medicinal substances (representing Body), five
fragrant substances (Speech), five essences (Mind), five
grains (Activities), and five precious substances (Quali-
ties). The consecrated water fills two-thirds of the flask,
symbolizing the Emanation Body (nirmāna-kāya) com-
bined with the pure visionary appearances of the Enjoy-
ment Body (sambhoga-kāya), while the formless Empti-
ness of the Truth Body (dharma-kīyo) is represented by
the one-third of empty space above.
As a hand-held attribute the vase or flask is de-
scribed and depicted with many variations: it may be
made of gold, silver, copper, crystal, ruby, sapphire
gemstones; may contain water, nectar, liquor,
treasure or jewels; and may be sealed with a moon-disk,
a vajra, a jewel, a bunch of leaves and fruit, a 'long-life
teat', or a lotus.

59. The flask or vase (ghata; bum-pa)
During the performance of many Vajrayāna rituals two
flasks or vases are used, known as the chief' or 'princi-
pal' flask (gtso-bum) and the ritual' or 'working' flask
(las-kyi bum-pa). The two may be identical in appear-
ance, but are often differentiated by Sanskrit or Tibetan
syllables inscribed around their necks. The principal
flask embodies the visualized mandala of deities within
its consecrated water, and the ritual flask is used for
the actual pouring of water for purification during the
stages of the ritual.
The flask is usually depicted as a small, round, metal
pot, with a flat base of lotus design, a narrow neck,
and a wide upper rim (Fig. 59a). A small pouring
spout extends upwards from the head of a makara on
the body of the flask, and a removable conical metal
sprinkler (kla-rgyan; Fig. 59 c), crowned with a bunch of
peacock feathers, fits into the aperture its upper rim.
60. The long-life vase (tshe-bum)
The long-life vase is a hand-held attribute of the
longevity deity Amitāyus, 'Infinite Life', and also an
attribute of a number of his human and divine mani-
festations. It is employed in longevity rituals, which are
often performed to increase the lifespan of the Sangha
or of a revered teacher.
The golden vase is filled to its top with the 'nectar
of immortality', consisting of pure stream water, dyed
with saffron and mixed with the twenty-five flask sub-
stances described above (59). The upper rim is
mented with four leaf-shaped pendants, which hang
down the side of the vase, symbolizing the four car-
dinal Buddhas of the mandala surrounding Amitabha,
the Buddha of 'Infinite Light', who resides at the cen-
ter. The top of the vase may be ornamented in sev-
eral ways: a red jewel, symbolizing Amitabha, may
crown it; or a golden aureole inscribed at its center
with Amitābha's syllable, HRIH; or a stem of fresh leaves
and fruit, such as the mango; or a wish-granting tree.
Padma-sambhava holds a skull-cup of nectar in his left
hand, inside which floats a small golden long-life vase.

The great Indian scholar Dipankara, or Atisa, who
revived Buddhism in Tibet during the eleventh century,
is depicted with a basket of books on one side and a
golden stapa on the other. Along with Atīša's own bod-
ily form these symbols represent the Buddha's Body
(Atīša), Speech (basket of books) and Mind (stapa).

64. The amulet-box (ga's)
The amulet-box is generally constructed as a small
round, square or torana-shaped metal reliquary con-
tainer for auspicious objects and substances. As an
item of Tibetan jewelry it is usually worn around the
neck and over the heart like a medallion, fastened by a
ribbon, thong, chain or necklace to two small handles
at its sides. The box is made from beaten bronze or
silver with an intricate top of repoussé work depicting
auspicious symbols, which are often gilded and stud-
ded with small turquoise, coral, pearl, lapis and amber
jewels. The front of the box commonly has an aureole-
shaped opening or window (prabha-torana), where a
small image of a deity may be displayed. The back
of the box is detachable to accommodate small sacred
objects such as precious stones, printed mantras, astro-
logical and protective charms, and various relics. As
a hand-held object the amulet-box is an attribute of
Ganapati.
The golden treasure vase or 'vase of inexhaustible
treasures' is mainly an attribute of wealth deities, and
is ritually employed for the activity of increase or
enrichment. Sealed treasure vases are often placed
or buried at sacred geomantic sites, such as mountain
passes, pilgrimage sites, springs, oceans and streams,
where their function is both to spread abundance to the
environment and to appease the indigenous spirits who
dwell in these places. The treasure vase is depicted as
on ornate golden pot overflowing with jewels. A large,
single wish-granting gem may seal its upper rim, or a
group of three gems representing the Buddha, Dharma,
and Sangha
62. The treasure box (nidhana-petaka; gter-
sgrom)
The treasure box or casket is a symbol of the tertöns
or treasure-revealers (gter-ston), who are usually great
masters of the Nyingma tradition and incarnations of
the twenty-five heart disciples of Padma-sambhava.
A large number of hidden treasures (gter-ma) were
concealed by Padma-sambhava and his consort Yeshe
Tsogyel in the Himalayan and Tibetan regions, to be
revealed at a future date by the tertöns, several hundred
of whom have appeared since the eleventh century.
The hidden treasure usually takes the form of ritual
implements and texts, which are often written upon
yellow paper in archaic script. The most famous hidden
treasure is the Bardo T'idol, better known as the 'Tibetan
Book of the Dead'
As a hand-held attribute the treasure casket is held
in the left hand by certain Nyingma masters, or it may
appear in a rock-fissure or cave in their surrounding
landscape It is usually depicted as a wicker or gold-
lidded container of a rectangular or round shape. A
precious jewel usually crowns the lid.

Basins and bowls are often depicted as offering recep-
tacles, containing a large variety of offerings such as
jewels, fruit, nectar, medicines, the eight auspicious
symbols and substances, the possessions of the Cakra-
vartin, and the offerings of the five senses. As a hand-
held attribute, a basin or bowl full of jewels is often
held by wealth deities. Ganapati often holds a tray of
his favorite sweetmeats (ladduka; la-du); and the five
hundred children' of the yaksī Hārīti hold bowls full of
barley-flour balls (rtsam-pa). The basin is usually de-
picted as an ornate golden vessel, often in the form of
a wide bowl or shallow tray. An iron bowl (Icags-snod,
par-bu), containing substances such as nectar, jewels,
diseases or human blood, appears as a hand-held at-
tribute of certain wrathful deities.

Tibetan Buddhism lists five or seven precious sub-
stances. Gold, silver, coral and pearl make up the first
four, and lapis lazuli, turquoise or'gemstones' the fifth.
Crystal replaces pearl in certain listings, and emerald
may be found in the place of gemstones. When a list
of seven precious substances is given they usually fol-
low the
e sequence: gold, silver, coral, pearl, lapis lazuli,
diamonds and
Depictions of jewels abound in Tibetan art, as of-
ferings, ornaments and attributes. Gemstone com-
parisons are extremely common in deity descriptions,
and the five primary colors of blue, white, yellow,
red and green are often equated with precious stones
and metals. The Sanskrit and Tibetan terms for the
jewel are frequently applied to great Indian panditos
and incarnate Tibetan lamas. The 'precious jewel' or
'wish-granting gem' are terms applied to the Bud-
dhas and their teachings, the 'Three Jewels' (tri-ratna;
dkon-mchog-gsum) being synonymous with the Buddha,
Dharma and Sangha
As offerings jewels are usually depicted as round
or pear-shaped objects, individually colored in a deep-
ening gradation from top to bottom. They may be ar-
ranged in lines or stacked pyramids, or in a combina-
tion of both. As a hand-held attribute the precious jewel
may be depicted as a flame-topped and pear-shaped
stone, or in the form of the faceted jewel described be

68. The wish-granting tree (kalpa-urksa, pärijäla;
dpag-bsam-gyi sin)
Pārijāta, the wish-granting tree that in Hindu myth
rose from the primal waters during the churning of
the ocean, is said to blossom at the summit of Mount
Meru in the centermost of Indra's five paradise groves,
Citra-ratha. It is on account of this tree that the asuras
wage a perpetual war with the devas, as the gods
freely partake of its divine flowers and fruit whilst
the jealous demigods dwell in comparative poverty
at the lower level of its roots and trunk. The pārijata
usually identified as the Indian coral tree (Erythrina
indica), but is most often depicted like a magnolia or
frangipani (campaka) tree. It is described as having
golden roots, a silver trunk, lapis lazuli branches, coral
leaves, pearl flowers, gemstone buds, and diamond
fruit. Iconographically the wish-granting tree may be
portrayed within a painted landscape, adorned with
flowers, silks and hanging jewels; or it may crown
the top of a long-life vase. The goddess Sramaņā-devi
holds a jeweled branch of this tree in her left hand.

The 'treasure mongoose' (gler-gyi ne'u-le)-which dis-
gorges a shower of jewels from its open mouth-is a
left-hand attribute of wealth deities, such as Jambhala,
Vaisravana or Kubera. It derives from the early Cen-
tral Asian custom of using a mongoose skin as a purse
or treasure bag, from which coins, precious stones or
cowrie-shells could be expelled through the creature's
mouth. The mongoose is also a traditional enemy of
snakes, which as nāgas are the guardians of treasures

67. The wish-granting gem (cinta-mani; yid-bzin

A wish-granting gem is said to exist in both the god
and nāga realms. As one of the seven possessions
of the universal monarch (cakravartin) this stone is
believed to all of
of the altruistic desires of its
owner. The Buddha and his teachings are in essence the
manifestation of this gem, and the prefix 'Cintamani
is also applied to Bodhisattvas, such as Avalokita and
Tārā. The wish-granting gem may be represented as a
red, orange, green or blue, pear-shaped gem, and may
also rest within a lotus, encompassed with an aureole
of flame. It may also appear as an eight-faceted jewel,
drawn as three elongated, club-shaped stems with a
pair of jewel tips and another, single tip rising above.
The bases of the stems often rest upon a moon-disk and
lotus, and are bound together at their tapering waist
with a silk ribbon or golden band. Although only six of

The 'victorious banner' was originally a military stan-
dard of ancient Indian warfare. Buddhism adopted it
as a symbol of Sakyamuni's victory over the armies of
Māra, whose demonic warriors bore it as an emblem.
This banner is said to have been placed at the summit of
Mount Meru as a symbol of the Buddha's victory over
the entire universe. As a hand-held attribute the banner
is held by many deities, particularly those associated
with wealth, such as Vaisravana, the great guardian
king
of
the north. Iconographically it is represented
as a cylindrical ensign mounted upon a wooden staff.
The top of the banner usually takes the form of a small,

granting gem at its center and encircled by an ornate
golden crest-bar at its edge, from which hangs a billow-
ing yellow or white silk scarf. The cylindrical body of
the banner is vertically draped with layers of multicol-
ored silk valances and hanging jewels, with a flowing
silk apron and cloth ribbons at its base. The upper part
of the cylinder is often adorned with a frieze of tiger-
skin. As a symbol of the Buddha's victory over the four
Māras, the banner frequently adorns the four corners of
a monastery or temple roof, and is similarly depicted
as a crowning ornament upon the outer walls of the
mandala palace.
71. The sea-monster or makara (chu-srin)
The sea- or water-monster known in Sanskrit as a
makorn is usually identified as a crocodile, whose fero-
cious jaws proverbially will not release their prey until
death. As a symbol of strength and tenacious grip the
form of the makara is widely represented upon weapons
such as the vajra, curved knife and ritual dagger. As a
symbol of the element water the head of a makara often
adorns the corner projections of temple roofs as a rain-
water gargoyle, or may appear at the source of a spring
as a carved waterspout. Pictorially and architecturally
a symmetrical pair of makaras are depicted along with
two nāgas and a crowning garuda or kirtimukha face-
upon the upper arches of doorways, or the forana that
rises behind the throne of a Buddha or deity image.
Sculpted forms of the forana are extremely common in
the Newar art and architecture of Nepal.
As an ancient Indian symbol the makara is a hy-
brid creature that possesses the wrathful nature of a
crocodile; with the lower jaw of a crocodile, the upper
trunk of an elephant, the tusks and ears of a wild boar,
the darting eyes of a monkey, the scales and flexible
body of a fish, and the swirling tail feathers of a pea-
cock. In Tibetan art the makara is depicted with two
lion's forepaws, a short, scaled body that terminates in
the tail of a fish, and a long, swirling tail composed of
elaborately scrolling tendrils.

73. The wolf, bull and tiger banner
As an ancient Indian battle-standard the banner was
often created from the staff-mounted head and flayed
skin of a ferocious animal, and in Vajrayāna iconog-
raphy these animal banners are held by many minor
deities and spirits. The Buddhist banner is also said to
symbolize eleven methods for overcoming defilements,
and a list of eleven animal banners, no doubt corre-
sponding, is found the makara or crocodile, tiger, wolf,
otter, goose, cat, peacock, frog, snake, scorpion and tor-
toise banners. However, the makara banner (72), the
wolf banner (orka-dhanja; spyan-ki'i rgyal-mishan; Fig.
73 a), the bull banner (orsa-dhunaja; khyu-mchog-gi rgyal-
mtshan; Fig. 73b), and the tiger banner (vyāghra-dhtaja;
stag-gi rgyal-mishan) are represented most often in the
hands ninor deities. The bull banner is an attribute
of the lion-mounted deity, Ganapati Mahäkäla (376).

74. The flag (pataka; ba-dan)
The flag is mainly an emblem of warrior or protective
deities, who may bear this attribute as a red or black
triangular pennon upon their spears and helmets.
More peacefully, square prayer-flags (rlun-ras, rlwi-
rta, run-dar)-printed in a five-color sequence with
prayers, mantras, deity images and auspicious symbols
--are strung or raised on flagpoles at sacred places.
The hanging squares of printed prayer-flags are often
divided by longer valances of colored silk, and the
flagpole is normally topped with a small victory-banner
or parasol (Fig. 74).

red and blue symbolizes the trinities of the Three
Jewels, the three Vehicles (yāna), the three 'scopes

symbolize the deity's purity of Body, Speech and Mind.
As a hand-held attribute the triple banderole is held
in one of the lower left hands of Vajra-bhairava, where
it again symbolizes the unity of the deity's Body, Speech
and Mind. Vajra-bhairava's triple banderole is
depicted hanging by a jeweled tassel from a trident-
staff,
symbolizing his triumph over the three realms,
Alternatively the triple banderole with its jeweled tassel
may hang
from a staff that is sealed at its top with the
emblems of a long-life vase and a crescent moon and
sun together (cf. Fig. 75 b). The triple banderole may
also hang as a banner from a jewel-topped staff within
a treasure vase, or as a pendant from an emblem such
as a parasol or a damaru, or an architectural adornment.

The jeweled tassel may be depicted as a small, jeweled
triple valance, or a series of white yaktails, that hang
from a scrolling or wajra-topped shaft. This implement,
which is used to confer blessings by touching it to the
heads of disciples, may appear as a hand-held attribute
of an Arhant or a celestial attendant of the Buddha.

79. The net (jāla; dra-ba)
The net, used to snare and entangle enemies, was one
of the weapons of the sky-god Indra, and in Buddhism
Indra's net (Indra-jala) is a metaphor for interdepen-
dence. A net with nine 'eyes' (dra-ba mig-dgu) is worn
on her back by the wrathful goddess, Vajra-remati.

80. The cemetery shroud (dur-khrod-kyi ras)
A white cotton cemetery shroud is a left-hand attribute
of Vajra-bhairava, symbolizing his triumph over death
and the destruction of the ignorance that perceives
phenomena as independently self-existing. Just as the
shroud veils the 'corpse' of selflessness, the removal of
this veil eliminates the obscurations to the realization
of Emptiness.

81. Intestines or entrails (antra; rgyu-ma)
A coiling length of human entrails (Fig. 81 a) is com-
mon in wrathful imagery, for example, among the dis-
membered corpses of charnel grounds, in the hanging
skin friezes of wrathful assemblies of offerings (rgyan-
tshogs), and as the cord that binds the fifty or fifty-
one severed heads that are worn as neck garlands by
wrathful deities. Entrails symbolize the realization of
the insubstantiality of the inherent existence of all phe-
nomena, which symbolically accords with their activity
of digesting the most varied and delicious of foodstuffs
and transforming them into common excrement. When
intestines are depicted with fresh blood in a skull-cup
they may represent the union of relative and absolute
truthor, on a deeper esoteric level, the arising of the
Illusory Body (entrails) from the state of Clear Light
(blood). As a hand-held attribute, symbolizing the in-
substantiality of all phenomena, a coiling noose of en-
trails (Fig. 81 b) is held by several wrathful deities, such
as Vajra-bhairava and Red Hayagrīva.

attribute of certain horse-mounted warrior deities, such
as Gesar of Ling. The golden shaft of the whip is sealed
with a jewel or half-vajra at its base, and from its top
flow a series of rope strands which diverge slightly like
the emanation of a rainbow.

78. The dharmôdaya (chos-kyi 'byun-gnas)
The dharmódnya or 'reality source' represents the visual-
ized ground from which certain deities arise, and may
be depicted
ed as a downward-pointing triangle, an in-
terlocking six-pointed star, or a triangular 'cara-rock',
which is placed below the lotus throne on which a deity
sits or stands. In the visualized generation of certain
deities the syllable E arises from Emptiness and trans-
forms into this geometrical structure, often in a three-
dimensional form as an inverted triangular pyramid or
tetrahedron. The mandala palaces of certain wrathful
deities are visualized in the form of the dharmôdaya-
for example, Vajra-yogini's, which is visualized as a
six-pointed star
Glossary: dharmôdaya.
82. The heart (sin-po)
A human heart (mi-sin), an enemy's heart (dgra-stiin),
the heart of Mara (bDud-säin), or a heart and lungs
(glo-stiin) may be held as an attribute of many wrathful
deities. The heart is usually held in the left, 'Wisdom
hand of the deity, and is depicted either being fed into
the mouth, being held aloft or at the level of the heart,
or as an object within the deity's blood-filled skull-cup.
The consuming of the heart and life vessels (srog-rtsa)
symbolizes the death of desire and the devouring of
all demonic enemies. The plucked-out heart is usually

86. The head of Brahmā (brahma-Siras; tshans-
pa'i mgo-bo)
The severed, four-faced head of the Hindu god of
creation, Brahmä, was originally an attribute of Siva. In
Buddhist iconography it became transferred to Saivite-
related deities such as Cakra-sambara, Kālacakra and
Vajra-bhairava. It symbolizes both the severing of all
conceptualizations, and the development of altruism
through the four immeasurables or 'divine abidings
(brahma vihara) of compassion, love, sympathetic joy
and equanimity. The head of Brahma is held by the
hair, and his four yellow faces are bearded and adorned
with flowers across their hairlines.

83. The severed arm (lag-pa) and leg (rkan-pa)
Severed body parts, such as vital organs, sense organs,
intestines, and dismembered limbs, are held by many
of the spirits in the retinues of wrathful deities. Two
severed arms and a leg are held as attributes in three of
the left hands of Vajra-bhairava. One of these arms (Fig.
83 3 a) includes a right hand, whose four outstretched fin-
gers signify his 'dexterity' in performing the four activi-
ties of calming, increasing, subjugating and destroying.
The second (Fig. 83b) is a left hand making the threat-
ening farjant gesture (120), indicating his wrath and the
terror that he instills in all demonic enemies. The sev-
ered leg and foot (Fig. 83c) symbolize the practitioner's
rapid progress along the Path to Enlightenment.

84. The piece of skull (thod-tshal)
An attribute described as a 'piece of skull' is held in
one of Vajra-bhairava's left, 'Wisdom' hands, and is
usually depicted like a conventional skull-cup but with
the peeling scalp and hair attached. This fresh or
moist skull (thod-rlon) full of blood signifies that Vajra-
bhairava's mental continuum (scalp and hair) is filled
with the nectar (blood) of great compassion
Piece of skull' is also applied to the five skull
ornaments on the crowns of wrathful deities: these are
said to be carved from pieces of human skull on which
the image of a skull is painted.

87. The fan (bsil-(Y)yab) and wind-cloth (rlun-
ras)
A fan of peacock feathers or white yaktails may be
held by the gods who are depicted as attendants of the
Buddha
In more wrathful form, a fan known as a 'wind-
cloth' (rluri-ras) is held in one of the left, 'Wisdom'
hands of Vajra-bhairava, and is depicted either as
a
white or green cloth attached to a single pole, or as
a rectangular piece of cloth fastened to two parallel
poles like a stretcher. This wind-cloth, which blows
away obscurations and fans the flames of Wisdom,
symbolizes by its changeable form the illusory nature
of all phenomena.

88. Black silk (dar-nag)
Multicolored silks and silk ribbons (dar-dpyans) of
white, blue, yellow, red and green are depicted as the
dress and adornments of deities, and a relationship be-
tween these five colors and the Five Buddhas is often
cited. White silk may be employed for calming rit-
uals, yellow for increasing, red for summoning, blue
for wrathful, and green for all-purpose activity. Black
silk is only employed for the most wrathful or necro-
mantic of rituals, where the absolute destruction of a
hindering demon or enemy is deemed necessary. As a
hand-held attribute a piece of black silk is held by the
yaksa Samanta-bhairava, and the goddess Candāli.
silk, black.
85. The severed head (mgo-bo)
A blood-dripping human head or mära's head (bdud-kyi
mgo-bo) is held as an attribute by certain minor deities,
symbolizing the severing of all abstract and tangible
conceptualizations or the decapitation of 'demonic en-
emies'. A rosary of eight severed heads symbolizes the
of the eight worldly bonds (> p.235 n. 3). The
long garland of fifty or fifty-one severed heads or skulls
worn by wrathful deities (Fig. 85) symbolizes either pu-
rification of speech as the fifty vowels and consonants
of the Sanskrit alphabet, or purification of mind as the
elimination of the fifty-one mental factors (caitta).

an ocean, surrounded by six or seven rings of golden
mountains and lakes. Beyond these mountains is the
circle of the great salt ocean, rimmed with a perimeter
of iron peaks and with the four main continents and
eight subcontinents appearing on its surface. The
entire universe of Mount Meru may rest upon disks
of the four elements of fire, water, air and space, with
an enormous crossed vajra representing the element
of earth supporting them. The goddess Gauri holds

The wooden pestle is an attribute held by Saivite-
related deities, such as Vajra-bhairava, Yamāri and
Ganapati. It is usually bone-shaped (Fig. 90a), and
symbolizes the revitalization of memory or the concen-
tration of cognition, just as the activity of the pestle
releases the fragrance of the herbs that it grinds into
a paste of 'one taste' (eka-rasa). The vajra-marked pes-
tle (vajra-musala; Fig. 90b) is depicted with a half-vajra
sealing the top of its handle.

91. The brazier (me-thab)
The iron or stone brazier is usually represented as a
wrathful triangular receptacle containing a blaze of
Wisdom-fire. It may be mounted upon a metal shaft
or have a small, rectangular fueling-door in one of its
sides. On an exoteric level the brazier symbolizes the
fire-rituals of the homa rite, and on an esoteric level the
innate awareness of the Clear Light ('od-gsal).
92. Fire (me-dpun)
The hand-held emblem of a blazing ball of Wisdom-fire
(ve-ses me-dpuri) symbolizes the ultimate incineration
of the five poisons of greed, hate, delusion, pride and
jealousy. The fire may emanate from the left, 'Wisdom'
palm of the deity, or may coil around the index finger,
which is raised in the threatening tarjani gesture.

The four great material elements may be represented
as hand-held attributes by an impaled frog or a yellow,

95. The sun (starya; fli-ma) and moon (candra;
zla-ba)
The sun and moon, as the major luminaries of our
world system, are one of the main polarity symbols
in Vajrayana Buddhism. The red or golden sun (Fig.
95 a) usually represents the female aspect, Wisdom, and
the white moon (Fig. 95b) the male aspect, Method or
compassion. Sometimes, however, the symbolism
reversed. Disks of the sun and moon are normally
painted in the upper sky of a thai-ka to the left and
right of the main deity, dividing the composition into
Wisdom and Method sides. The sun and moon symbol-
ize absolute and relative truth, and on an esoteric level
the red and white bodhicifta 'drops' that flow through
the psychic channels (nadt) of the subtle body and have
their origin in the navel and crown centers respectively.
The two main channels that ascend along the left and
right sides of the central channel are identified as solar
and lunar respectively (the reverse of their identifica-
tion in Hindu yoga). The solar and lunar disks upon
which deities sit or stand often indicate the Wisdom or
Method quality of the deity; they may be described as
being of precious 'sun-crystal' (sürya-luinta; me-sel) and
'moon-crystal' (candra-kānta; chut-sel). As attributes the
disks of sun and moon may appear as earrings, head
and body adornments, or hand-held objects. A blazing
sun is also depicted at the navel of certain deities, and
a crescent moon may depicted at the crown.

Bowls of flowers and fruit are frequently depicted as of
ferings to peaceful deities, or as sense offerings to rep-
resent and gratify the faculties of scent and taste. Flow-
ers are often stylized into a form resembling a peony or
chrysanthemum, or depicted like daisies or colored lo-
tus blossoms, Fruit is usually depicted more naturally,
and the forms of the peach, plum, mango, orange, cit-
ron, bilva, banana, pomegranate and coconut may be
identified. In Chinese art the pomegranate, peach and
citron are known as the 'three fruits of blessings' sym-
bolizing happiness, longevity and wealth respectively.

100. The myrobalan fruit (haritaki; a-ru-ra)
The sacred medicinal fruit of the myrobalan tree (Termi-
nalia chebula) is the main attribute of the Medicine Guru,
Bhaisajya-guru (sMan-bla), who holds a stem bearing
three myrobalan fruits in his right hand and an alms-
bowl containing three more myrobalan fruits in his left
hand. The myrobalan or 'cherry-plum' is an astringent
fruit that resembles a prune when dried and produces a
yellow dye. In both the Indian Ayurvedic and Tibetan
medical systems it is highly esteemed as a preventative
and curative panacea. In Tibetan it is known as the
'king of all medicines" (sman-mchog rgyal-po), and var-
ious parts of the tree—its roots, stem, branches, bark,
leaves and fruit—are used to cure diseases of the bone,
muscle, blood vessels, skin, viscera or vital organs, and
heart respectively. Eight varieties of myrobalan fruit
are listed in the Tibetan medical system, and eleven
in the Indian Ayurvedic system. Each of these vari-
eties differing properties, tastes, qualities, colors
and shapes, and the fruit may be stylistically depicted
in a number of forms.

97. The bilva fruit (bil-ba)
The bil fruit (Aegle marmelos) is also known as the
bel, bael, Bengal quince, and wood-apple-because of
its thick, hard, wood-like skin. In ancient India it was
sacred to many Hindu deities such as Siva, Parvatī,
Lakşmi, Durga and Surya, and served as the main fruit
offering to temple deities. Only in more recent times
has the
bilve been superseded by the coconut as
the
principal fruit offering. Early Buddhism adopted the
bilva fruit as one of the 'eight auspicious substances',
and it is frequently depicted in Buddhist art, often in
a group of three. It is a round, astringent fruit about
the size of an orange, with a thick, reddish brown skin
and trifoliate leaves. A medicinal jam is made from the
urripe pith, which is particularly effective in intestinal
illnesses such as dysentery and diarrhoea.
99
101. The radish (mülaka; la-phug)
The white radish (Raphanus sativus) is an emblem of
the elephant-headed Hindu and Buddhist deity, Gana-
pati or Ganeša. It is usually held in Ganapati's right
hand, and is often topped with three long leaves. Along
with a sweetmeat known as ladduka (la-du), it is Gana-
pati's favorite foodstuff and symbolizes the essence of
the earth element. Radish like meat, fish, garlic and
onions is a tamasic or 'black' food that is forbidden in
pure or sattvic rituals.

98. The citron (jambhara, jambira, bija-puraka;
bi-dza-pa-ra-ka)
The yellow citron fruit or Asian lemon is an attribute of
the goddess Cunda-devī, and of several of the forms of
the wealth gods Vaiśravaņa, Jambhala and Kubera. It
is a symbol of prosperity and is often held in the right
palm of a wealth deity making the gesture of generosity,
and may be paired with the jewel-disgorging mongoose
held in the right hand.

Durvā grass (Cynodon dactylon) is a common Indian
grass which is also known in the western world as
Bermuda grass, Bahama grass, scutch grass or devil
grass (Fig. 102 a). In ancient India it was a sacred
plant used to bind the cow-dung bricks of the Vedic
altar, and early Buddhism adopted it as one of the
eight auspicious substances. As a hand-held attribute

deities are also described as sitting under specific trees
or standing with their back resting against the trunk
of a certain tree. Khadira-vani Tärā, for example, is
depicted in a grove of acacia trees (khadira; sen Iden),

a bunch of dūri grass is carried by Tekar Drozangma,
one of the four sisters of Trashi Ts'eringma.
In Tibetan art dūroz grass is often depicted as kuća
grass (Poa cynosuroides), a brush-like grass still used in
India for the household broom (Fig. 102 b). Kusa is also
a sacred grass used in rituals of purification. The sacred
fire was kindled from a bunch of kusa grass, and brah-
mins would sleep in a grove of kuśn grass when ritual
purification was required. In Buddhist fire rituals kuśn
grass may also be used to kindle the sacred homa fire.
Its stems are used to sprinkle consecrated water and are
also placed under a mattress or meditation seat to re-
veal auspicious dreams and to enhance concentration.
Both dūrvi and kusu grass are known by the common
term of darba or durba grass.
103. The ear of corn ('bru'i stie-ma)
An ear of corn is one of the left-hand attributes of the
wealth goddess Vasudhārā (Nor-rgyun-ma), who holds
an ear of grain as a symbol of prosperity and abundant
harvests. An ear of corn from a winter harvest (dgun-
'bru) is held in one of the 38 secondary hands of the
1050-armed form of Avalokita, known as the 'King of
Space'.

108. The asoka tree (asoka; a-seva-ka, mya-nan-
med-pa'i Sini)
The tall and slender asoka tree (Saraca indica) is a com-
mon Asiatic tree with long fluted leaves and a seasonal
abundance of red flowers. The term asoka means 'with-
out sadness', and the tree is sacred to Kamadeva, the
Hindu god of love and desire. In Buddhism it-is the
hodhi-tree of the Universal Buddha Vipaśyin, and an
emblem of the goddess Märīci. An asoka tree or a flow-
ering branch of the tree is held by several of the forms
of Mārīci and by several of the Twenty-one Täras.
105. The ear of rice ('bras-kyi se-ma)
An ear of abundant rice may also be held as a left-hand
attribute by certain forms of the wealth goddess Vasu-
dhārā. It also occurs as a common left-hand attribute
of the nine Mothers, as the directional consorts of the
nine manifestations of Many-deity Jambhala.

The Sanskrit term mudrā literally means a seal, mark or
sign, and in Buddhist terminology is mainly used to re-
fer to the hand configurations or gestures that Buddhas
and deities make. In early Mahāyāna Buddhism only a
few main mudrās were depicted upon sculpted Buddha
images, and these possibly became the distinguishing
gestures of the Five Buddhas-with the Enlightenment
or teaching mudra assigned to Vairocana, the earth-
touching mudrā to Aksobhya, the boon-granting mudrā
to Ratna-sambhava, the meditation mudrā to Amitabha,
and the protection
mudra to
With the proliferation of iconic imagery in later
Vajrayana Buddhisma
na larger number of oudras became
incorporated into the
the vast pantheon of deities. A list of
thirty-six major hand gestures is sometimes given, com-
prising twelve single-handed or 'uncombined' (asam-
yukla) gestures and twenty-four two-handed or 'com-
bined' (samyukta) gestures. More often a list of twelve
principal deity mudras is found, although the number
of hand gestures performed in the
many Vajrayāna rit-
uals worshipping these deities is far
hand gestures are classified
mudrās; some
-such as the raised threatening forefinger (120), or
snapping the fingers in the mode of dance" (gar-ba"?
Ishul-gyis se-gol tog-pa)—are simply named by a descrip-
tion of a particular finger configuration. The Sanskrit
term hasta—'hand'-may also be used to describe a
gesture, particularly when the hand holds an object or
ritual attribute.
In Vajrayāna iconography each of the five fingers is
identified with one of the Five Buddhas, so a mandala
of the Five Buddhas is naturally formed when the four
fingertips are grouped together around the tip of the
thumb. The thumb is identified as the white syllable
OM of Vairocana, the forefinger as the blue syllable
HCM of Aksobhya, the second finger as the yellow
syllable TRAM of Ratna-sambhava, the third finger as
the red syllable HRĪŅ Of Amitabha, and the little finger
as the green syllable A of Amogha-siddhi. In Kala-
cakra's iconography--which differs from other tantric
systems in its placement and colors of the Five Buddhas
and elements--the back of the thumb is colored in the
yellow of the element earth, the forefinger in the white
of water, the second finger in the red of fire, the third
finger in the black of air, and the little finger in the green
110. The boon-granting gesture (vara-da-mudrā;
mchog-sbyin-gyi phyng-rgya)
The boon-granting gesture or gesture of generosity
is made with the palm held outwards and down-
wards and all the fingers loosely outstretched or curved
slightly inwards (Fig. 110a). It represents 'open-
handed' generosity or the granting of wishes, and is
invariably made with the right or 'Method' hand. This
mudra
is very common amongst peaceful deities, par-
ticularly those performing the auspicious activities of
calming and enriching. Wealth-bestowing deities may
hold an attribute of enrichment within a
cupped right
palm in orada-mudra, or may perform the activities
of 'raining jewels or nectar' by circling the right hand
with the open palm downwards. Deities such as White
Tara, Sitâtapatrā, and Thousand-armed Avalokita are
depicted with a 'Wisdom-eye' in the palm of each hand
(Fig. 110 b), symbolizing that the five 'Method' Perfec-
tions (paramita) of Giving, Morality, Patience, Energy
and Concentration (represented by the five fingers) are
supported by or depend upon the sixth Perfection, Wis-
dom (represented by the eye in the center of the palm).
111. The protection gesture (abhaya-mudrā; mi-
'jigs-pa'i phyag-rgya) or gesture of giving
refuge (skyabs-sbyin-gyi phyag-rgya)
The gesture of giving refuge, also called the gesture
of protection or fearlessness, is usually made with
the right hand, with the palm held outwards and the
fingers extending upwards. In appearance it is similar
to the boon-granting gesture, except that the hand
points upwards instead of downwards. The gesture
of giving refuge may also be depicted with either the

rest upon the lap the right hand is placed above the

(right hand) depend upon, or are supported by the
Perfection of Wisdom (left hand). The dhyana-mudra is

114. The earth-touching gesture (bhimy-
akramana; sa-gnon)
The earth-touching gesture is performed by the right
hand reaching downwards to touch the ground with
the extended fingertips. This gesture symbolizes the
moment when the aspiring Buddha, Šakyamuni, van-
quished the army of Māra beneath the bodhi-tree and
called upon the earth goddess to bear witness to his re-
nunciation and realization. It is the mudri of Aksobhya
Buddha, and symbolizes resolve, power, immovability
and victory

as the union of Method and Wisdom, and the three
extended fingers represent the taking of refuge in the
Three Jewels of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

112. The Wheel of Dharma gesture
(dharmacokra-mudrā; chos-kyi 'khor-lo'i phyag-
rgya)
The Wheel of Dharma gesture, or gesture of explaining
the Dharma (chos-'chad-kyi phyag-rgya), often loosely re-
ferred to as the teaching gesture', represents the mudra
assumed by Sakyamuni Buddha when he gave his first
discourse at the Deer Park in Sarnath, near Vārāṇasī.
This historical event is known as the Buddha's first
Turning of the Wheel of Dharma', where he set in mo-
tion the perfect wheel of his teachings. The curators of
Sarnath Museum nowadays demonstrate with the aid
of a loosely knotted handkerchief how the Buddha used
the configuration of the diarmacakra-mudri to untie the
'knot of
f appearances'.
The dharmacakra-mudrā is a combined hand gesture
formed with both hands positioned in front of the
deity's heart, with the right hand facing palm outwards
and the left palm inwards. The tips of the index
fingers and thumbs of both hands usually touch each
other lightly; alternatively, only the joined index finger
and thumb of the right hand may touch one of the
left fingers. The circle formed by the index finger
and thumb symbolizes the Wheel of Dharma, and the
three curving extended fingers the various trinities of
the Buddhist path. The right, Method' palm facing
outwards represents the transmission of the teachings
to others, and the left, 'Wisdom' palm facing inwards
represents the inner realization of the teachings within
oneself. The gesture of teaching may also be depicted
with only the right, 'Method' hand held in dharmacakra-
mudra, and the left, Wisdom' hand resting upon the lap
in the dhyana-mudra of meditation upon Emptiness.
113. The meditation gesture (dhyāna-mudrā;
mñam-gzag-gi phyag-rgya, etc.)
The gesture of meditation, or of concentration (tin-nie-
'dzin-gyi phyag-rgya), is performed by resting either
the left hand (Fig. 113 a) or both hands (Fig. 113b)
in the lap with the palms facing upwards and the
fingers extended. When only the left, 'Wisdom' hand
makes this mudra, the right, 'Method' hand may be
represented in any mudri or may hold a ritual object
closed
115
115. The Enlightenment gesture (bodhyangi-
mudrā; byan-chub mchog-gi phyag-rgya)
The mudrā of Enlightenment-literally, 'of principal En-
lightenment—is the chief gesture of Vairocana Bud-
dha. It is a combined hand gesture formed with both
hands positioned in front of the heart, with the raised
forefinger of the left hand encircled by the I fist
of the right hand. An alternative form of Vairocana's
Enlightenment mudrā is made by enclosing the raised
thumb of the left fist in the four fingers of the
the thumb symbolizing Vairocana at the center of the
mandala, and the four embracing fingers of the right
hand the four directional Buddhas that surround him.
If the positions of the hands in bodhyangi-mudra are re-
versed, the raised right, Method' finger symbolizes the
interpenetration of the vajra into the 'lotus fist of the
left, 'Wisdom' hand.
Enlightenment, gesture of principal.
116. Palms folded (afijali; thal-mo sbyar-ba)
The placing together of the palms at the level of the
heart is the traditional Indian gesture of salutation, re-
spect and adoration known namaskara-mudra, and is
probably the most ancient of Indian mudrās. In Bud-
dhist iconography this gesture is described as 'palms
folded' or pressed together, and is the principal ges-
ture of several of the forms of Avalokita and his atten-
dants. Avalokita, in four-armed, eleven-faced and
thousand-armed forms, holds a tapering wish-granting
gem between his slightly cupped palms, symbolizing

phyag-rgya) is identified with the Hamkīra-mudrā made
by Wrathful Sambara and Vajra-hümkära.
A variant of the Hamkāra-mudrā may be made by
crossing the forearms with the palms facing outwards
(> Glossary: Hümkāra gesture). This is similar to the
spirit-subduing gesture described below.
117. The Cundā gesture (Cunda-mudrā; [Lha-mo
Isunda'i) rtsa-ba'i phyag-rgya)
The Cundā gesture is the characteristic mudrā of the
female Bodhisattva Cunda. It is similar to the anjali of
Avalokita, and is formed by holding the palms of both
hands together in front of the heart, with the forefingers
pressing upon the middle joints of the second fingers
and the tips of the thumbs pressed upon the bases of
the forefingers.

119. The spirit-subduing gesture (bhata-
dāmara-mudra; 'byun-po 'dul-byed-kyi phyag-
rgya)
The spirit-subduing gesture is a specific mudrā of the
wrathful four-armed form of Vajrapani, known as
Bhūta-dāmara ('Byun-dul), or 'Spirit-subduer'. It is
formed
by crossing the right forearm over the left and
linking the little fingers into the shape of a chain. Both
palms face outwards, with the second and third fingers
curved inwards and the index fingers slightly extended.
The shape of this mudrd resembles the two outspread
wings of Garuda, and is said to terrify and subdue all
malignant spirits.

118. The Hümkāra gesture (Hum-mdzad-kyi
phyag-rgya) or gesture of Victory over the
Three Worlds
Hümkāra, 'the Syllable HUM', is a name given to a
wrathful form of the deity Sambara, also called Trai-
lokya-vijaya, Victorious over the Three Worlds'. Many
of the semi-wrathful, blue Yidam deities that emanate
from the Buddha Aksobhya, such as Sambara, Heruka,
Guhyasamāja, Kālacakra and Vajra-hūmkāra, are de-
picted with their two principal arms crossed in Vajra-
dhara's gesture, the Hamkara-mudrā. Vajra-dhara is the
Lord of all the Buddha Families, and the primordial
Dharma-kāya form in which Sakyamuni Buddha mani-
fests in order to reveal the Tantras.
The Hamkara-mudra is a combined hand gesture
formed by crossing the forearms over the heart, with
the right, Method' forearm placed in front of the left,
'Wisdom' forearm. The two hands are closed into
loose fists, with the second and third fingers forming
circles with the thumbs and the first and fourth fingers
extended into vajra-mudra (rdo-rje phyag-rgya). Often
the deity holds the Method and Wisdom attributes of
a vajra and bell in his crossed right and left hands, and
this principal gesture is often identified as vajra- rūm-
kāra-mudra.

120. The threatening forefinger (tarjani; sdig-
mdzub)
The raised threatening forefinger not actually
classified as a mudrā, as it is performed with the index
finger alone. As a gesture of wrath or threat the index
finger is raised from the fist like a hook or a pointing
finger. Many wrathful deities perform this gesture,
particularly when they hold a noose or a hook in their
hands. The raised index finger symbolizes the wrathful
nature of Aksobhya's syllable HOM, and the
may also be known as the 'hook' (ankuša; lcags-kyu). Its
threatening power is perhaps most vividly expressed in
the iconography of Black Hayagriva, who is
is described
as wielding a blazing iron hook in his left hand, with a
black iron scorpion poised to sting upon the tip of his
raised index finger. The correspondence of the raised
and curved index finger, the hook and the scorpion's
tail reveals the wrathful malice replicated within this
forefinger, threatening.

forceful gesture.



Identification Guide
This is an index to the Icons Worthwhile to See arranged morpholog-
ically, using information from both the textual descriptions and
the paintings.
The primary types
The primary classification is by the morphological type of the
image, defined in terms of the following schema:
I. Buddha: one face, two arms, male, wearing the robes of a
monk. No ornaments. Peaceful, meditative expression with
two barely open eyes. The hair is short, dark blue and curly
and the crown of the head bears the characteristic protuberance
(usnīsa). All those in IWS are seated upright in vajra-paryanka.
II. Peaceful deity (Bodhisattva): peaceful characteristics include:
slender build;
peaceful expression on principal face, with eyes only just
open, usually two in number, and mouth closed;
hair black, part tied up in a topknot and part falling over the
shoulders;
lower and upper garments of silks or 'heavenly stuffs';
jewel ornaments;
halo round head, body-nimbus of light-rays optionally en-
closed by rainbow(s) and/or the design of jeweled gold
curlicues called nor-'dzin pa-tra;
seat is usually lotus and moon;
posture: usually either seated in a rigid cross-legged posture
with at least one leg tightly bent, or standing with feet
together.
The deity may be male, female, or both embracing.
IIY. Peaceful yakşa: like a peaceful deity but heavily built, with
stout limbs and a big belly, and with a rather fierce expression:
the mouth may be pursed and the eyes wide open and staring,
though not red and bulging like those of a wrathful deity. Male
yaksas generally wear a mustache. Those wearing armor are
counted as semi-wrathful (IITY).
III. Semi-wrathful deity: any mixture of peaceful and wrath-
ful characteristics, ranging from predominantly peaceful with
just a hint of wrathfulness to strongly wrathful, but not fully
wrathful in every point. There are also some specifically semi-
wrathful characteristics:
facial expressions in which the mouth is slightly open and/or
the eyes wide open but not red and bulging;
body-nimbus of light-rays enclosed by a border of flames
and/or wind.
The postures of dancing on one leg and standing alīdha, asso-
ciated with the important dākini (female) and heruka (male)
sub-types respectively, are typically but not exclusively
semi-wrathful.
We here count a deity as semi-wrathful if it is disqualified
from being of fully peaceful or fully wrathful type on at least
two counts, either in the textual description or the painting,
precedence being given to the text in case of discrepancy.
IIY. Semi-wrathful yakṣa or king. Yaksas are again distin-
guished from ordinary semi-wrathful deities by their heavy
build and sometimes also by facial characteristics. Kings are
similar and may be recognized by their exceptionally bulky,
rich clothes. Both kings and male yakşas (not mutually exclu-
sive groups) have mustac

IV. Fully wrathful deity. Wrathful characteristics include:
heavy build, with thick limbs and pot-belly,
face distorted and terrifying, with three round, bulging, red
eyes, and mouth gaping with four large fangs and rolled-
up tongue;
hair tawny, yellow or brown, generally upward-streaming
or else hanging down loose;
usually wearing tiger-skin loincloth, often with a scarf of
elephant or human skin; if female, may well be naked;
some male protectors wear a heavy brocade cloak and
boots;
long necklace of fifty human heads, crown of five skulls;
jewel or bone ornaments, often snakes as ornaments;
instead of a halo and body-nimbus of light-rays, deity is
surrounded by flames and/or wind;
sun seat, often with corpse(s) as well;
posture typically standing pratyālīdha; if sitting, the legs will
only be loosely crossed.
Fully wrathful yaksas are indistinguishable from other fully
wrathful deities so are classed as normal Type IV.
V. Animal or composite deity. Any deity whose principal face is
that of an animal or bird, or whose lower half is in the form of
a snake, a bird or a dagger.
VI. Human: one face, two arms, flesh-colored, the face depicted
with strong individual characterization. The pose and indeed
the whole scene may be much less formal than in a deity image.
If the degree of wrathfulness of a deity is not clearly defined, it
may be necessary to check two type classes. A few borderline
cases (especially where the portrayal seems at odds with the
description) have been listed twice under different classes.
other than posture, however, the textual descriptions are given
precedence, though the pictures have been used to provide details
that the text fails to specify.
The postures are ordered, broadly, from the most peaceful
(vajra-paryanka) to the most wrathful (standing pratyalīdha), fol-
lowed by cases where the deity is riding an animal. Often the di-
rection in which the head and upper body of the deity are leaning
is included as a subdivision of the posture; though not mentioned
in our texts, for at least some deities this is well defined by artistic
tradition and has symbolic significance. In the posture 'sitting
with R (or L) foot lowered', the knee may be slightly raised, the
foot advanced a little and resting on the seat rather than 'lowered',
or the opposite foot held straight rather than at the usual angle to
the leg; this index does not distinguish these variants.
Within each posture group, unless some other grouping princi-
ple imposes itself, the deities are generally ordered alphabetically
by the principal right hand emblem or gesture, ignoring qualify-
ing words.
Note that in the descriptions below, terminology has been stan-
dardized and verbal variations that correspond to no visible differ-
ence, e.g. 'blue'/'black' or 'golden'/'yellow', are not maintained.
Right and Left (R, L) are always defined from the deity's point
of view, and often refer to the right and left hands. The order
of hands has been adjusted in a few cases, consistent with the
general principle of counting pairs of hands at the heart first and
numbering the others from the top down.
In the case of couples (male and female deities embracing), M
refers to the male deity and P to the female (prajña).
Eyes are counted per face, or occasionally just for the principal
face. Front, right, left and back faces are denoted where necessary
with lower case letters f, r, 1, b; if faces are in more than one tier
the numbers in each tier are given, starting from the bottom, and
colors of a tier of three are given in the order f, r, 1. If no color is
given, the face is the same color as the body.
(*)' after a deity's name indicates that it appears as an atten-
dant, so the description may be sketchier than for most principal
deities and the illustration possibly of smaller scale. The pos-
ture and direction of lean may be influenced by compositional
considerations.
Arrangement within a type
Within each type class, the deities are successively divided by
gender, number and arrangement of faces, number of arms,
and posture, before proceeding to analysis of their individual
distinguishing marks. It is important to note that the posture
descriptions are based on the paintings rather than the texts
and it is possible another artist would render a particular deity
differently (article Postures in the General Index). In respects
